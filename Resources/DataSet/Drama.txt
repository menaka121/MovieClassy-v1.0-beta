Renï¿½ Artois runs a small cafï¿½ in France during World War II. He always seems to have his hands full: He's having affairs with most of his waitresses, he's keeping his wife happy, he's trying to please the German soldiers who frequent his cafï¿½, and he's running a major underground operation for the Resistance. Quite often, the Germans' incompetence itself is what nearly lands Renï¿½ and his cohorts in hot water; they are not helped either by the locals, who are dreadfully keen to get rid of the Germans, but their blatant and theatrical attempts at espionage and secrecy often create problems that Renï¿½ must solve quickly. Two years have elapsed and it is now September 1943. The airmen have escaped to England and Bertorelli and the Italian troops have withdrawn. Rene's hopes for peace and quiet are, however, dashed as Yvette announces her pregnancy. With the war now seeming to turn against Germany, Von Klinkerhoffen considers assassinating Hitler. Gruber and Von Strohm hope to sell the original painting, sell it and flee to Spain so they get Helga to steal it. To ensure her cut when the sale goes ahead she 'removes' one of the Fallen Madonna's boobies as her insurance. Monsieur Alphonse has started working on the statue of Renï¿½. Meanwhile, the final preparations for the parade to the coast (a cover in order to be able to get German plans in British hands) are made. General Von Klinkerhoffen wants to talk with the colonel and Gruber about the details concerning the plot to blow up Hilter. To make sure they aren't overheard, they'll discuss the plans during a game of golf. Eavesdropping Helga tells Herr Flick they're going golfing to discuss something important and Herr Flick decides to go, with Von Smallhausen and Helga, to the golf course to find out what they'll be discussing. Colonel Von Strohm and Gruber agree to pay the ransom the Resistance ordered them to pay via a dogfish. They put the ten million francs in the dogfish and go to the river where the dogfish is to be exchanged for the incriminating photo. The dogfish however doesn't end up in the hands of the Resistance and the colonel and Gruber still don't have the photo. Meanwhile, general Von Klinkerhoffen has ordered Renï¿½ and Edith to dress up as Hitler and Gï¿½ring pretending to leave town because he plans to catch any Resistance group that tries to attack them. Rene is not looking forward to marrying Denise and agrees to a romantic dinner with Edith. Michelle has abducted Denise and hidden her in an old mine shaft, the plan being that Edith will take her place at the altar next day. Gruber, not happy at seeing the man he loves get married, is charged by the general to ask Rene where the paintings are and is assured that they are safe. The wedding goes ahead and Rene is surprised to see, when she lifts her veil, that his bride is Edith, not Denise. However the marriage is not legal because, in a counter-plan to prevent the union, the vicar has been replaced by Crabtree. Now that General Von Klinkerhoffen is in the hospital, General Von Flockenstuffen is in command. He wants to redecorate Von Strohm's office and doesn't make himself very popular with Von Strohm, Helga and Bertorelli. Gruber however, likes him and gets to help in the redecoration. Meanwhile, madame Fanny and Ernest Leclerc have been arrested for stealing a motor bike and smashing through a German road block. Herr Flick thinks the old couple might have information about the British airmen and orders Von Smallhausen to commit a minor crime so he can be arrested and put in a cell with them in order to find out what they know. Rene and the Cafe staff prepare to welcome the invading British troops, and soon find that the invasion party includes a couple of old friends. Lieutenant Gruber and the Colonel are ordered by the General to stay and fight the invaders, rather than surrender. However, seeing as their defeat is almost certain, the two German officers decide to go AWOL, disguised in stolen British uniforms. The second half of the episode is set many years after the war ends. Gruber, the Colonel and Helga, now private German citizens, return to their old French garrison in search of the old friends they made there. Michelle sets out to blackmail Gruber, having discovered him with the photo of the painting, so he and Von Strohm hold up the German pay truck for the hush money. Flick finds out from Helga, to whom he has given a truth drug, but he and Von Smallhausen arrive too late to prevent the robbery and are arrested by Von Klinkerhoffen as the perpetrators. Rene, meanwhile, makes his first propaganda broadcast. Michelle once again has a new and totally absurd plan to get the British airmen back home and Renï¿½ has had it: He secretly plans to take the train to Switzerland with Yvette and the paintings. Unfortunately Helga tells Renï¿½ to give colonel Von Strohm the paintings because Hitler himself wants the paintings and has send an art expert to verify their authenticity. Edith and Rene manage to free Madame Fanny and LeClerc and hide them in a folding bed in the wall upstairs at the cafe. However they become literally embedded in the wall as the bed gets stuck and Alphonse decides to use dynamite to shift it. This is a total success but it also blows up the two Gestapo officers who have come to interrogate the old couple. Gruber however comes in to say they have been pardoned. Von Fluckenstuffen's plan to kidnap Hitler does not go down well with the other officers when they learn that they are to be part of his suicide squad. However Von Fluckenstuffen gets drunk and demands to inspect Rene's cellar,accusing him of keeping back his best wines. To guide his way he lights a candle,in reality a stick of dynamite which explodes,giving him a nervous breakdown. Thus he changes places with Von Klinkerhoffen in the 'fruitcake ward' and Rene is to be recommended for a medal. Michelle wants Rene to set up a mobile radio station to broadcast propaganda, the parts of which will be dropped by plane. Unfortunately they fall down one of the chateau's chimneys. Happily a Spanish flamenco group are booked to perform there so Rene and his staff impersonate them. Gruber is aware that the real dance troupe contains a Spanish art expert to whom he is to give a photograph of the painting for copying, but he gives it to Alphonse by mistake. Gruber is worried about the compromising photo of him with the painting of the Fallen Madonna with the big boobies the Resistance has and, with the colonel, decides to make a down payment on the ransom they demanded. Helga is still trying to rescue Herr Flick and Von Smallhausen using yet another disguise. Meanwhile, lead is needed for the battery of the mobile radio station and Yvette, Mimi, officer Crabtree and monsieur Alphonse go to the church in disguise to steal some lead from the roof. Gruber and the colonel have to play Hitler and Gï¿½ring once more and end up being captured by the communist Resistance. Flick and Von Smallhausen tunnel their way into the camp, only to find that, along with Gruber, everybody has escaped disguised as dancing girls. Flick intercepts Rene's call to London but Rene, realizing this, destroys his radio. The Resistance now have no radio. Nor do they have Maria, who disguised herself as a Red Cross parcel, but, due to insufficient stamps, was sent back to Switzerland. Geering has also gone, since the Resistance assumed he was an escaping British officer and took him to London, where he now has an office in Piccadilly Circus. The resistance has found out that the Germans are planning to commandeer the pudding factory where the resistance had hidden the 1,000 kilo of explosives from the land mines. Because they don't want the Germans to have the explosives, the 1,000 kilo will be brought to Cafï¿½ Renï¿½, disguised as 500 Christmas puddings. Meanwhile, General Von Klinkerhoffen has ordered colonel Von Strohm and Gruber to find the stolen land mines and Herr Flick and Von Smallhausen (both in disguise) try to spy on the back room of Cafï¿½ Renï¿½ from the local church. Herr Flick tells Helga the money that was stolen from the bank was his and he suspects General von Klinkerhoffen has stolen it. Michelle tells Renï¿½ and the others the stolen money will not be used to safe Mimi and the Germans but it will be split amongst them. When officer Crabtree tells them the money was from the Gestapo, it ends up in Renï¿½'s trousers. Meanwhile, Renï¿½ has found a way to improve Edith's performance. General Von Klinkerhoffen is furious about the escape of the British airmen and announces he'll blow up the whole of Nouvion in 48 hours if the airmen are not in the hands of to the Germans by then. Herr Flick finds out about this and, because it'll take him months to make enemies in a new town, orders Von Smallhausen to dismantle the bombs. Michelle also hears about Von Klinkerhoffen's plan but still wants the airmen back to England. Her plan is to get them back by barrage balloon. Because a big barrage balloon might cause suspicion from the Germans, Madame Fanny and Ernest Leclerc need to wed so a marquee can cover the balloon. Rene manages to photograph the safe,which is in Gruber's room and which LeClerc believes he can blow open. Alphonse tells Edith of Rene's affair with Yvette but she believes his denial. Von Klinkerhoffen takes a fancy to Helga and they have a private dinner in his room. Flick and Von Smallhausen,posing as gypsy violinists,serenade them in order to learn whether the general intends to kill Hitler. Smoke bombs are to be dropped down Gruber's chimney,causing a diversion which will allow Rene and LeClerc to come in and open the safe. By mistake the smoke bombs are thrown down the general's chimney instead and he calls the fire brigade. Flick,dragged up as Irma Von Kinkenrotten,the disguise he used to plant the bug,is still in the dungeon. Von Strohm and Von Klinkerhoffen,aware that he knows of the forgeries,feel he should be silenced and hatch a plan. The Resistance,led by Rene dressed as Himmler,will spring him. The German officers,dressed as Gestapo,whom they will blame if anything goes wrong,are to thwart the escape and put paid to Flick. However,the Resistance have effected the escape before the Germans arrive and they find only Rene,who has swapped places with Flick as the prisoner. While Renï¿½ is preparing to visit the empty grave of his fake dead twin brother, he is told by Michelle when to go because the Resistance is building a communication center in the grave to be able to contact London since the Germans jam the original radio station. Gruber, still not over the fact that it was he who shot Renï¿½'s twin brother, decides, after finding out Renï¿½ is going to the grave, to also go the grave, along with Helga. Meanwhile, Herr Flick and Von Smallhausen have a plan to find the headquarters of the Resistance: They will disguise themselves as shot-down British airmen and expect to be taken to the headquarters without any trouble. Madame Fanny has found a new love in Ernest Leclerc, brother of Roger Leclerc. Colonel von Strohm wants the two paintings that are hidden in a statue at the chï¿½teau. He tells Renï¿½ and the staff of the cafï¿½ to pretend to be the Excelsior Quartet who are scheduled to play at the chï¿½teau and at the right moment steal the paintings out of the statue. The resistance also wants them to steal something, namely the Enigma machine the Germans recently acquired. Mimi, hidden in the double bass case, will take care of this. Herr Flick and Von Smallhausen are also going to the chï¿½teau disguised as serving maids because Herr Flick thinks some of the guests might be involved in the plot to blow up Hitler. General Von Klinkerhoffen orders that Renï¿½ is to be shot if the Enigma machine isn't found. Because he thinks he might warn Renï¿½, colonel Von Strohm orders Gruber to take of his uniform so he won't leave Von Strohm's office. Nevertheless, Gruber takes Helga's uniform and goes to Renï¿½. Meanwhile, British Intelligence and the Resistance have thought up a plan to get two experts to Nouvion to look at the Enigma machine. They will be disguised as policemen. Renï¿½ and monsieur Leclerq have been captured by the communist resistance. The leader of the group turns out to be Denise Laroque, an old sweetheart of Renï¿½. Because of this, Renï¿½ and Leclerq won't be killed, but Renï¿½ has to marry Denise. Meanwhile the British airmen have had it with hiding at Cafe Renï¿½ and try to surrender to Germans so they can get into a proper prisoner of war camp. Herr Flick tells Helga the stolen Gestapo money was false. When she tells this to the colonel he tells Bertorelli to get it back to Renï¿½. What Bertorelli doesn't know is that Von Strohm anonymously called Herr Flick to say a man with feathers on his hat has the stolen money and is on his way to Cafe Renï¿½. Michelle has a new plan to get the British airmen back to England; they'll be put in two emptied land mines and dropped over England. They then need to 'unscrew their nuts' and land safely using their parachutes. The parachutes will be brought by monsieur Leclerq, who'll be disguised as a pillow-stuffer. Meanwhile, the communist girls leave Cafe Renï¿½. Colonel Von Strohm and Gruber have failed to escape to Spain and come back to cafï¿½ Renï¿½. Edith thinks up a plan for them to make general Von Klinkerhoffen believe they had been kipnapped by the Resistance: They are to hide in the old windmill in order to fake their kidnapping. Unfortunately, general Von Klinkerhoffen has planned target practices using the windmill as target. Meanwhile, Herr Flick has had plastic surgery so he can flee to Argentina when the war is over. Gruber and the colonel are still disguised as Hitler and Gï¿½ring and are still being hold by the Communist Resistance. Michelle finds out about this and (because she, like the communists, doesn't know it are not really Hitler and Gï¿½ring) decides to kidnap them so the French Resistance will get the honor of ending the war. Meanwhile, Herr Flick and Von Smallhausen are about to face the firing squad for robbing the German pay truck. Renï¿½ is going to be given the collaboration medal by the Germans. If he accepts it, the resistance will have him shot. If he doesn't, the Germans will have him shot. Therefore he plans to go to England with Yvette, instead of the two British airmen, Fairfax and Carstairs. Rene has successfully got the painting back so Michelle concentrates on her plan to get the airmen away in the ancient aeroplane. It is to be drawn by a car and catapulted into the air,requiring Rene to steal 800 metres of men's braces,which he does under the guise of his Brotherhood of the Night-Owl. Flick and Helga,aware that something may be afoot,turn up in his staff car but it is flattened by a runaway steam-roller so they miss seeing the failed escape when the plane fails to take off and Rene is flung through the air. When feeding the long distance duck, Renï¿½ sees she has given birth to a group of ducklings. Nevertheless, Michelle orders Renï¿½ to launch the duck. Gruber, colonel Von Strohm, Helga and captain Bertorelli are dividing the money that was stolen from the bank and Herr Flick - who owned the stolen money - is ordered by his uncle Heinrich Himmler to find the money again, even though it was forged money. Herr Flick and Von Smallhausen start selling fish in the town square hoping somebody will pay with the forged money so they can arrest and interrogate this person. Meanwhile, hearty eaters Denise Laroque and Louise are still hiding at Cafe Renï¿½. To replace Maria,Michelle brings in Mimi Labonq,who is very tiny but very tenacious and vows to be Rene's bodyguard. She is also very fanatical and Rene has to stop her from poisoning Flick. A new radio is also brought to the cafe by Roger LeClerc but this coincides with the arrival of Geering's replacement,the Italian Captain Bertorelli. He too almost falls victim to Mimi when he misunderstands her invitation to go upstairs and look at some paintings. Gruber is about to mince the sausage his dog brought in when he discovers the painting. The Resistance pay off Alphonse,who provided the ransom money,with notes forged by LeClerc whilst Gruber is ordered to fake another copy of the picture. Michelle intends to get the airman out using an old aeroplane in the museum. It will be powered by the motor from Von Klinkerhoffen's lawn mower,which she has smuggled out in Madame Fanny's wheelchair. Michelle saves Renï¿½'s skin and his reputation by telling Alphonse that he is an heroic member of the Resistance. Alphonse thus has too much respect for him to kill him. However Rene is in drag, which gets him more attention from Gruber. Flick has imprisoned Von Strahm and Geering and also captures Rene, planning to torture them to reveal what happened to the painting. Fortunately Von Klinkerhoffen stops him as he has more influential connections than Flick in the German high command. The airmen are taken to the balloon dressed as mourners in a fake funeral for Madame Fanny who has allegedly died of the plague. Because she is pregnant with his child, Yvette talks Renï¿½ into trying to arrange a marriage. Michelle hears Hitler and Gï¿½ring will come to Nouvion and plans to blow them up. What Michelle doesn't know, is that they aren't the real Hitler and Gï¿½ring. Herr Flick, still in jail with Von Smallhausen, waiting to get executed, tells Helga he knows Von Strohm and Gruber robbed the pay truck and that he will tell the general this unless they rescue him. A plan is thought up: Helga, disguised as a nun, will bring Herr Flick a stick of dynamite, disguised as a knackwurst. And to think all of this is happening at Renï¿½'s birthday! Herr Flick has arrested monsieur Leclerc because he thinks he has the stolen money. When it turns out he hasn't got the money, Herr Flick announces Leclerc will be shot if the money won't be returned. Unfortunately, Madame Fanny has burned the money - that was kept in the oven - when trying to cook a potato, which actually was the spy camera that was to be used to photograph the invasion of England plans. Meanwhile, Von Strohm has found out about the two missing land mines and tells Gruber to talk to Renï¿½, in case he might know anything about them. Rene considers flight to Spain dressed as an onion-seller but is stopped by the German officers who ask about the painting. It ends up back with Von Klinkerhoffen, to the annoyance of Flick, who asks Helga help him retrieve it. However she flirts with Bertorelli to make him jealous. Michelle puts the airmen in wine barrels in Rene's cellar to smuggle them out but the general turns up and orders that the barrels be sent to the chateau. General Von Klinkerhoffen asks Von Strohm and Gruber who knew about the meeting of the generals where someone tried to poison them. When Von Strohm tells him Renï¿½ knew about it, Von Klinkerhoffen tells them to catch and execute Renï¿½. Herr Flick however, thinks the big-nosed French collaborating general had something to do with the plot to poison the generals and tries to find him. Meanwhile, Renï¿½ wants to quit the resistance and gets several disguises he can use to avoid being caught. While he was in the bell tower of the church, Herr Flick saw the two stolen land mines in the Butcher's Yard next to Cafï¿½ Renï¿½. When he and Von Smallhausen find out they are empty, they both hide inside them in order to catch resistance members when they come to transport the mines. Meanwhile, Helga told the colonel and Gruber the whereabouts of the land mines and the colonel - not knowing the mines are empty and harmless and Flick and Von Smallhausen are in them - orders Bertorelli and his men to move the land mines to the German air base. After finding out about this, Michelle comes up with a plan to get the British airmen into the mines and back to England. Renï¿½ is kept by the communist Resistance as a love slave in their underground hide-out in the forest. Meanwhile, everybody thinks Renï¿½ has died in the windmill explosion. Everybody is very saddened and officer Crabtree comes up with the idea to erect a statue in memory of Renï¿½. The colonel and Gruber, when visiting the cafï¿½ to find out where the painting is and express their sympathy, agree to pay for the statue. Meanwhile, Herr Flick takes of the bandages and reveals his new face while Renï¿½ tries to escape from the Resistance. Because Berlin blames him for the cock-up concerning the meeting of the German generals, general Von Klinkerhoffen decides to send colonel Von Strohm and Gruber to the Russian front. Von Strohm and Gruber want to flee to the Vatican and hide out there until the war is over. For this, they need to sell the paintings that are hidden in the headquarters of the Communist Resistance. They tell Renï¿½ to get the paintings. When Michelle of the resistance hears of this, she tells Renï¿½ to get the paintings, give copies to the colonel and Gruber and sell the originals for the resistance funds. The airmen,wearing German uniforms,are captured by the Maquis,but escape and burn the uniforms,taking clothes off scarecrows instead before disguising themselves as onion sellers. Von Strohm and Geering,now without uniforms,are angry with Rene and he is given two carrier pigeons to send to London for replacement uniforms. He uses the radio transmitter hidden under Madame Fanny's bed instead when Edith kills and cooks the pigeons. Because of the precautions taken by Edith and Yvette & Mimi, Renï¿½ hasn't married Denise Laroque. Now Renï¿½ is afraid Denise wants to kill him and tries - while being disguised as his own father - to find a place to hide. The colonel and the captain tell him they can't help him but the colonel decides a disguised Helga should protect him because Renï¿½ is the only one who knows where the paintings are. Meanwhile, the British airmen are still trying to find a way out of their never changing status quo of being stuck at Cafe Renï¿½'s. The airmen are disguised as waitresses at the cafe.However,Von Klinkerhoffen recognizes a Van Gogh,behind which Rene has hidden The Fallen Madonna,and he requisitions it to be taken to the chateau,along with the two 'waitresses'. To thwart this an elaborate pantomime is staged,whereby the two men dress as tarts out to seduce Rene.A supposedly enraged Edith then 'shoots' them with a gun loaded with blanks. The 'corpses' are taken to Alphonse's funeral parlour under which a tunnel has been dug,connecting to the prisoner-of-war camp across the road,in which it is planned to hide the two fugitives. The newspaper is published with Edith on the cover representing the 'Spirit of Nouvion'. For the second edition the general decides there should be a show marriage,to be annulled after the war,in order to cement local relations. Edith will marry one of the occupying officers - Bertorelli. There will be a celebration and this will include wine - from the barrels containing the airmen. Michelle and her group manage to float the barrels out through the sewers but they get stuck behind a grid under the cafe. Whilst the suspicious Flick and his henchman Von Smallhausen dig their own tunnel into the camp,the prisoners are planning a mass escape. Von Strohm volunteers Geering as the first to go and he is catapulted over the wire and spirited away into the woods by the Resistance. Gruber dresses as a nun in order to get into the camp to free the others but they take advantage of an entertainment about to be staged and dress up as dancing girls. The Resistance capture Von Stahm and Geering, whom they intend to shoot in return for the death of the late cafe owner. The task of shooting them is to be given to Rene in revenge for his brother's slaying. Fortunately he is able to enable all three of them to escape in time to meet the plane bringing the forged painting back from England,which they intend to return to Flick. Unfortunately it is only after the hand-over has been accomplished that they discover that they gave him the genuine original and they have the copy. Monsieur Alphonse has asked Edith to marry him. When Renï¿½ hears about this and figures he'll lose the cafï¿½ and everything in it (notably the gold in the cuckoo's clock), he decides to ask Edith to marry him and she says yes. Bertorelli will cook a great feast and monsieur Alphonse, being the deputy mayor, will marry them. Meanwhile, general Von Klinkerhoffen suspects colonel Von Strohm of stealing his gold while Herr Flick thinks it was Renï¿½ who took the gold. Herr Flick tells Helga to use her feminine charm to elicit the whereabouts of the gold from Renï¿½. Renï¿½ is back home and Michelle tells him that, with the Germans thinking he's dead, she has planned for him to go to England to help the British win the war. When this plan is postponed, Renï¿½ hides out in the museum where his shoes and beret (which is all that is believed to be left of him after the windmill explosion) will soon be exhibited. Meanwhile, Herr Flick, just like colonel Von Strohm, still wants to know where the painting is and invites madame Edith over for tea. Madame Fanny and monsieur Leclerc return from Paris. On the discovery that a gypsy fair takes place annually in the village, the new Resistance plan is to place a gypsy tent over the grid to disguise the escape. However, the real gypsies cry off, following a bad omen, and Rene and his staff take their places. Rene is a fortune teller, to whom Gruber comes, seeking a message from Rene's 'brother' on the other side. He is frightened off by the sounds of the airmen and runs off as they emerge from the grid - followed by three other airmen, who return to the sewer at the sight of Edith. Flick has Elsa put the forgery in von Strohm's office but they are found out by the general. Von Klinkerhoffen assumes that the 'gypsies' caused the smoke bomb incident and orders their arrest,so they hide in the wardrobe. This gets blown to bits when LeClerc blows the safe up,but its contents are not the invasion plans but the original Fallen Madonna painting and the Van Gogh the general stole from Rene.The Gestapo officers, Rene and LeClerc all escape but the last two are disguised as Germans and are captured by the Communist Resistance and held prisoner in an old saw-mill. Flick believes the safe blew up because Gruber was hiding explosives with which to kill Hitler and orders Helga to chat him up to find out more. Whilst she is doing so Crabtree and the resistance steal Gruber's tank in order to rescue Rene and LeClerc but Edith crashes it into the village's public convenience. Because they think he's gone round the twist, the Germans call General Von Flockenstoffen to deal with Von Klinkerhoffen who still wants to blow up the whole of Nouvion. Herr Flick and Von Smallhausen try to disarm the bomb in the sewer while an old flame of Renï¿½ has her own plan to stop the Germans from blowing up the town. Meanwhile, Ernest Leclerc and madame Fanny have just been wed and in the marquee the celebrations have started while the Resistance girls are secretly working on the barrage balloon that should get the British airmen back to England. Michelle brings a bottle of nitro-glycerine to the cafe for safe keeping until it is time for her to use it to blow up a German train. However as it is in a gin bottle Edith thinks it really is gin and gives some to Madame Fanny. Rene and the two German officers meet the plane bringing their uniforms but on board there is only a Jewish tailor who takes their measurements. He does,however,take the painting of The Fallen Madonna with the Big Boobies back to London to be copied. Rene is annoyed when the airmen return and sends them away dressed as nuns with instructions to hide in the local convent. Edith,officially a widow,finds Rene's will,naming her as sole beneficiary,and sets out to spend his money on a new hat to attract other suitors. Flick gets Gruber,who once worked in an art gallery,to identify the original painting whilst the 'nuns' return and end up hiding in the piano. The hinges on the grid are rusted on solid so Alphonse will chisel away at the surrounds and the grating will be winched up. To camouflage the action Rene will park his old ice cream van over the grating. However Von Klinkerhoffen decides that he wants an ice cream and,at that very moment,the winch pulling the grating up blows the pump on the ice cream maker,covering the general with vanilla ice cream. Meanwhile Helga has gone on a training course and her replacement,Elsa,takes an instant shine to Flick. Renï¿½ and Edith get rescued from being shot by general Von Karzibrot by British troops. However, the British think they are Hitler and Gï¿½ring and arrest them. Meanwhile, everybody thinks Renï¿½ and Edith are death. Michelle takes over the cafï¿½ while madame Fanny and Leclerc run off to Paris in Renï¿½'s old ice cream car. Colonel Von Strohm and Gruber want to flee to Spain because the Resistance will sent the photo of Gruber with the painting to general Von Klinkerhoffen. Before they go, they plan to swap the painting for the ten million francs Herr Flick found in a dogfish Von Smallhausen made for dinner. Flick comes across Michelle by the roadside,lying in wait for an ammunition lorry which she plans to blow up with a detonator disguised as a bicycle pump - however Flick mistakes it for a genuine cycle pump and blows his car up. Another escape attempt is to be made for the airmen,this time in a balloon and silk knickers are vanishing from the village washing lines to provide the material. Rene explains that the knickers are actually providing the material for Edith's wedding dress,as she has agreed to re-marry him. Monsieur Alphonse,who is already wooing Edith, is enraged at being spurned and challenges Rene to a duel. Flick and Von Smallhausen are interrogated by the general for impersonating army officers but released on the orders of Himmler - thanks to Helga. A party of intelligence officers are visiting and the Resistance plan to hi-jack their car,steal their uniforms and that way infiltrate the chateau to get the airmen out. Rene and Edith are the reluctant 'intelligence officers' but the plan works fairly well until the couple find themselves handcuffed to the airmen whilst the key to unlock them is in Berlin. The Communist Resistance has captured Von Strohm, Gruber, Bertorelli and his men. Renï¿½ (still disguised as a Franciscian vicar) has given them the copies of the paintings - which they think are the real ones - and convinces the communists not to shoot them, but ask ransom for them. The communists let Renï¿½ and Leclerq go and decide to keep Mini (who's still disguised as a baby, with the original paintings in her nappies). It turns out general Von Klinkerhoffen won't pay the ransom and Michelle suggests robbing the town bank in order to pay the ransom and get Von Strohm, Gruber, Bertorelli, Mimi and, most important, the paintings back safe and sound. A plan to flee to Geneva Renï¿½ and Yvette made will have to wait because general Von Klinkerhoffen - in order to find the stolen Enigma machine - has decided no one is to leave the town or they'll be shot. Michelle, who is disguised as a pregnant woman in order to fool the Germans, delivers Renï¿½ the Enigma machine and tells him to put it in a wine barrel and throw it in the sewer. The whole population of Nouvion will flush the toilet at the same time which will enable the barrel to reach the canal where a British submarine is waiting for the Enigma machine. World War II is raging, but in the French village of Nouvion, cafï¿½ owner Rene Artois wants only a quiet life, plus some slap and tickle with his waitress Yvette behind his sour wife Edith's back. To this end, he keeps in with two German officers who are regular cafï¿½ patrons, Kurt Von Strohm and Hans Geering. He is therefore alarmed when Michelle of the Resistance declares his house a safe house for two British airmen who have been shot down and who don't speak a word of French. He is also to host Roger Leclerc, a forger and old flame of his mother-in-law Fanny, who was sprung from jail by the Resistance but, due to a misunderstanding, mistakes Hubert Gruber, a German officer who turns out to be gay and fancies Renï¿½, for the forger. Geering and Von Strohm discover the hidden British airmen, but when Herr Otto Flick of the Gestapo arrives, they agree to help. This is because Flick is after a favourite painting of Hitler's, "The Fallen Madonna with the Big Boobies," which they wish to keep for themselves. To this end, they give their uniforms to the escaping airmen. General Von Klinkerhoffen wants to continue the meeting of the Generals, but because he thinks the Communist Resistance might want to blow them up, he has planned for a group of peasants to be dressed up like generals and come together at the town square while the generals - disguised as onion sellers - will meet at the cafï¿½. A new group of shot down British airmen will also come to the cafï¿½, also disguised as onion sellers. Meanwhile, Herr Flick is recovering in traction and Leclerc and Madame Fanny are going out for a walk. Rene is finally rescued by Gruber and returns to the cafe,where Michelle tells him that he must take the camera,hidden in a potato,into the chateau and photograph the invasion plans in the safe. The general is lured away to the cafe,where,surviving a seduction attempt by Edith,he finds the colonel in bed with Yvette. Rene is about to enter the chateau when there is an air raid. Herr Flick is worried about his career in the Gestapo after all the recent cock-ups and feels he has to flee. For this he needs money and he demands Renï¿½ to give him the painting so he can sell it. Von Strohm, Gruber, Helga and Bertorelli also want the painting back and sell it because the escape of the airmen has made them nervous about their futures too. Meanwhile, Crabtree is reunited with an old love! Hearing that Flick intends to send the painting back to Berlin next day Von Stahm directs Rene to make the switch that night. A diversion is arranged in the form of a Hitler Youth Dance,in which local girls dressed in Bavarian costumes will perform for the Gestapo officer's delight. Meanwhile Rene and Edith,wearing the German uniforms that arrived on the plane,will take the forgery back to Flick's office. Unfortunately the guard takes the painting from them and sends them away. Now Flick has the original,the London forgery and one he made himself to work a fiddle that would get him money to marry Helga after the war.Meanwhile the airmen are smuggled to the coast but,on hearing that there is no submarine for them and they must row home,return to the village. Whilst the balloon is ready for the off the cowardly Rene tries to duck out of the duel. Gruber,who is in love with him,offers to take his place,whilst Von Strohm and Geering plan to kill Alphonse before the duel can take place. However the plan is thwarted when Hitler,having discovered that there was no painting on the train,orders Flick to arrest the culprits, whom Flick knows to be the German officers. Rene,therefore,is forced to take part in the duel. General Von Klinkenhoff of the German High Command is to arrive in Nouvion by train. Von Strohm and Geering are not keen to see him as he will find out about their incompetence and allow themselves to assist the Reistance in blowing up his train. The General survives and various suspects are arrested but ultimately only Rene is identified as a saboteur and is sentenced to be shot. Various people try to help him escape from prison but in vain. However as Gruber prepares to supervise the execution Von Stahm substitutes harmless wooden bullets for the lethal real ones. After his arrest, monsieur Alphonse is in the hands of the Gestapo and will be interrogated. Colonel Von Strohm and Gruber fear he might talk and give them away and give Renï¿½ a suicide pill to go in a pastry. In the headquarters of Herr Flick, Helga tells monsieur Alphonse she's on his side because she also has some of the forged money. However, when she shows him where she has hidden the money, monsieur Alphonse has a heart attack. Colonel Von Strohm wants to hand Renï¿½ over to the Gestapo along with the painting of the fallen Madonna with the big boobies by Van Klomp to get rid of Herr Flick, but Renï¿½ convinces them that it would be a better idea to try to forge the painting, give that to the Gestapo and split the money from the painting after the war. Captain Hans finds out that putting cheese in one's ears improves the sound of madame Edith's singing. Herr Flick has a plan to find the painting of the Fallen Madonna with the Big Boobies: He and Von Smallhausen will kidnap Yvette and Mimi, dress up like them, take their keys and go to the cafï¿½ in order to find the painting. General Von Klinkerhoffen tells the colonel and Gruber he's planning to blow up Hitler. He'll send the Fï¿½hrer the painting in an explosive list which will blow him up. Because they don't actually have the painting, former forger monsieur Leclerc will paint it, with Helga posing as the Fallen Madonna. Michelle has an important microfilm that should get to England by homing pigeon. Flick suspects Von Strohm and the general of being part of a plot to kill Hitler and plants a microphone,disguised as a daffodil,in the general's office but the only conversation is the Germans trying to get rid of Bertorelli. The Resistance need an aerial to be placed above Flick's jamming signal to block it out so Mimi,dressed as a nun,is sent up in the air attached to a box kite. She asks London to send explosives. Alphonse catches Rene and Yvette at it and regards Edith as back on the market. Rene's funeral is to be arranged by the village undertaker Monsieur Alphonse. Flick,along with his girl-friend,Private Helga,will be watching on the off-chance that the mourners will include other Resistance members who can then be arrested,but the plan is leaked so that Monsieur LeClerc will pose as the priest and no Resistance members will attend. Rene himself is passed off as his twin brother from Nancy,also called Rene,come to pay his respects. In the absence of a body Michelle hides some anti-tank missiles that she has been given in the coffin but of course it falls off the hearse,causing an explosion. The balloon crashes and the airmen end up back at the cafe,disguised by moose heads. General Von Klinkerhoffen assumes control of the whole area, thereby making many enemies. The Resistance hate him for obvious reasons but Von Strohm,Geering and Flick also feel undermined by his presence. Therefore,at a party he is organizing to mark the Kaiser's birthday,plans are made to kill him,involving poison - in the pill by the till in the jug with the drug - and dynamite hidden in a birthday cake - the candle with the handle in the gateau from the chateau. The poison actually turns out to be aspirin and the candle seems likely to explode and kill everybody so Rene tips a bucket of sand over it,explaining to Von Klinkerhoffen that it was done as a respectful gesture to mark the Kaiser's birthday. The generals gather for the conference but the Resistance learn that one is a French collaborator and must be eliminated so Mimi poisons him and Crabtree takes his place. The duck which will carry the message to England escapes and is shot by Bertorelli but the rest of the plan goes ahead. Edith causes a diversion by offering the generals a curiously strong peppermint each which is a doctored pill which has them foaming at the mouth and requires them to go to hospital. Rene then takes a photograph of the plans using a camera concealed in a 'flip-up' apron. Flick meanwhile has Helga fitted for her - leather -wedding dress. On the Geneva Express Renï¿½ tries to avoid Edith and convinces Mimi to aboard the train. The colonel and Helga replace the original paintings by copies and Herr Flick - not knowing of this switch - replaces the copies by... other copies. Yvette and Leclerc also show up on the train. Yvette has found out Renï¿½ wanted to elope with her and Leclerc has come aboard to warn Renï¿½ the Resistance will blow up the train! Maddened by anti-Nazi propaganda he found in the town, general Von Klinkerhoffen decides to restart publishing the local newspaper. It should be filled with Nazi propaganda and Renï¿½ should be the editor-in-chief. To show the human side of the Germans, it is decided there should be a photo in the paper where the Germans and the occupied peasants are shown having a good time together. Meanwhile, Herr Flick and Von Smallhausen (freed from the monastery by Helga) are short of cash. Renï¿½ and Michelle learn about the plan of the Gestapo to find the headquarters of the Resistance by disguising themselves as British airmen. The Resistance decides to take the bait and plan to lock Herr Flick and Von Smallhausen up, with the help of Officer Crabtree, Renï¿½ and his whole staff, all in disguise. Meanwhile, Von Klinkerhoffen also heard about the plan of the Gestapo and can't stand the thought of the Gestapo succeeding where he has failed and tells Bertorelli his men will also pretend to be shot-down British airmen in order to find out where the headquarters of the Resistance is. As Rene communicates with London on the radio hidden under Madame Fanny's bed Flick listens in and learns of the plan to dig the tunnel into the prison camp. The airmen and Alphonse need help in digging so Rene and his staff join in. Von Strohm and Geering follow Rene and go through the tunnel,which collapses behind them,trapping them and Rene in the camp with the airmen and the cafe staff. Von Klinkerhoffen is about to make his inspection of the prisoners but the Germans and the girls are disguised as British servicemen and fool him. The British air force drops a spy camera with which the Resistance are to photograph the plans for the German invasion of England. However the camera lands in Alphonse's vineyard,which Von Klinkerhoffen has commandeered. When he orders the locals to harvest the grapes the camera is rescued and two attempts made to kill the general. One involves poisoned wine but Alphonse ends up with the glass and spits out the wine.The reserve plan has explosives hidden in Madame Fanny's wheelchair but this too goes wrong and the wheelchair goes whizzing across the countryside. Rene is thrown out of their truck by the Communists and reports that the paintings are with the Communists at their head-quarters. The general plans an attack to recover them,using Bertorelli's Italians but they are lazy and unwilling to cooperate. A generals' conference is to be held in which the invasion of England is likely to be discussed. Michelle gets Rene to do the catering and to get as much information as he can on the invasion. The results will be sent back to England with a long-distance duck. After the plan with the submarine went awry, the British airmen have been captured by the Germans and have been locked in a cell in the chï¿½teau. They'll be transported to Berlin the next day. Gruber gives Renï¿½ the keys to the chï¿½teau and the cell to rescue the airmen because his name could be dropped if the airmen start talking while interrogated. Michelle thinks up a plan involving coffins to rescue the airmen and Herr Flick and Von Smallhausen also think up a plan, involving disguising themselves, to get their hands on the airmen. Flick's sausage,containing the forged painting,is kidnapped by the Communist resistance,who demand a ransom for its return. Von Strohm and Geering,anxious that Flick does not discover their part in the deception,get Rene to pay the ransom,which he does with money Edith obtains from Alphonse. Dressed as a German soldier Rene drops off the money,observed by both German and French parties,also in disguise. However Gruber turns up with his dog,who runs off with the sausage. Because they were disguised as British airmen, Herr Flick and Von Smallhausen have been captured and are taken to Von Klinkerhoffen who asks a description of the Resistance members. When Von Klinkerhoffen doesn't believe the description Flick and Von Smallhausen give, he demands Helga to marry Herr Flick so she can keep an eye on him because he doesn't trust Flick one bit. Meanwhile, the British airmen are finally going into the canal to go to the submarine that's waiting for them. Dressed as a pantomime cow the two airmen narrowly avoid being milked before going to a landing field to pick up their plane home. Unfortunately all the plane does is drop by parachute an intelligence officer called Crabtree,who poses as a gendarme and mangles every attempt at the language. Von Stahm and Rene meanwhile have to stop the train from reaching Berlin as it is carrying the sausage which does not contain the painting. They plan to blow it up and blame the Resistance but fail to do so and the train passes them by. The Resistance are awaiting batteries,stolen from the Germans,to operate the wireless under the bed and,in the meantime,Michelle has Rene and Yvette pedalling a bicycle attached to a generator to power it. Helga exposes Flick's efforts to bug the general's office and Von Klinkerhoffen has him arrested. Gruber completes his forgery of the painting and delivers it wrapped up in a sausage. However it gets mixed up with real sausages and ones containing batteries and explosives. Waitress Maria is sent to Gruber with the genuine painting in order for him to copy it. However she is intercepted by Von Klinkerhoffen who puts the painting,inside the sausage,in his wardrobe and refuses to release Maria until he gets his lawn mower motor back. Rene,Von Strohm,Geering and Flick,using the secret passages,break into the chateau to steal back the painting. Michelle tells Renï¿½, Edith and Mimi the Resistance is short of cash and Mimi tells her about the painting of the Fallen Madonna Herr Flick has in his safe. Michelle decides they'll try to steal it. After Herr Flick told Helga he doesn't want to have anything to do with her anymore (something that was decided by his godfather Heinrich Himmler), she, the colonel, Gruber and Bertorelli also plan to steal the painting. Meanwhile, the local paper, run by Renï¿½, has a 'Spirit of Nouvion' contest and Edith, Michelle and Mimi all feel they are the true spirit of Nouvion. Hitler wants the painting of the Fallen Madonna Herr Flick has. Herr Flick decides to give an ignorant colonel Von Strohm a forgery to send to Hitler and tells Renï¿½ to hide the real painting, which is concealed in a sausage, in his kitchen. Herr Flick tells Helga about his plan, but she clues in colonel Von Strohm and they too hatch a plan. Now that they're officially no longer married and Renï¿½ is posing as his own twin brother, Renï¿½ has to marry Edith again to 'get his finger back in his own till'. This is complicated by the fact he loves Yvette and Marie instead of Edith and there are more men who want their hands on the cafï¿½ and woo Edith. Meanwhile, the two British airmen are dressed as a cow for yet another escape plan. Instead of with Yvette, Renï¿½ finds himself on a plane to London with Edith. In London Renï¿½ and Edith come across captain Hans Geering, who now works for the English. Renï¿½ wants to stay in England for the rest of the war while Edith wants to go back to look after the cafï¿½.

Among the biggest: Janet Jackson's Super Bowl "wardrobe malfunction," the Van Doren "Quiz Show" scandal, and how reality shows such as Survivor and American Idol launched a new genre. Journalists such as Tom Brokaw discuss the debate between John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon, the O.J. Simpson trial and the birth of CNN. Larry King explains how his talk show paved the way for the viewer participation format. And Frank Gifford addresses the start of Monday Night Football. Robin Roberts, Bryant Gumbel and Cynthia McFadden and various pop-culture experts will weigh in about how these major moments influenced the powerful medium. A joint effort of the VH1 cable network and TV Guide magazine, this five-part series offered a countdown of the 100 greatest musical moments ever telecast. Each episode offered 20 of those moments on a descending scale (i.e. 100-81, 80-61, etc.). Among the highlights, represented via film and video excerpts and eyewitness recollections, were the creation of MTV, Michael Jackson's "Moonwalk," Britney Spears' first appearance on Star Search, the debuts of such musically oriented series as The Monkees and The Sonny and Cher Show, and even such celebrated disasters as Mariah Carey's "strip meltdown" on Total Request Live. The same list appeared both on VH1 and in the pages of TV Guide, though there were a few discrepancies in the rankings. For example, while VH1 had once rated the Beatles' American debut on The Ed Sullivan Show as the number one TV musical event of all time, TV Guide superseded this with Bill Clinton's saxophone solo on The Arsenio Hall Show.

Captain Dula is assigned as a pilot to the 918th, and in only his second mission, his plane is shot down with the loss of his entire crew. This earns him a reputation as a jinx, and Gallagher restricts him to non-pilot duties. On a subsequent mission, Dula takes umbrage at critical remarks from Komansky. When Gallagher and Stovall are wounded, Dula takes over the piloting and gives Komansky an order which he ignores while trying to save Stovall. Dula demands that an entry be made to the log noting Komansky's "mutiny". Later, Komansky comes into possession of a letter from another survivor of Dula's previous mission who is in a POW camp in Germany that implies that the captain abandoned his crew and plane without warning. He shows Dula the letter, after which he tries to play down his log entry. On their next mission, however, Komansky is seriously hurt, and his very survival may be in Dula's hands. Under heavy pressure to find a well concealed target in France, Savage flies a stripped down B-17 (no bombs, guns, or crew) on a desperate photo-reconnaissance mission. After he is shot down, he is discovered by a Frenchman who tries to kill him, but Savage turns the table, purely in self-defense, and dispatches his attacker. Unaware that his action was witnessed by the man's son, he later meets the boy and pleads for help in getting his vital information back to England. Instead, the boy turns him over to a group of French civilians who despise the Americans for bombing their homeland, and now they want to make Savage pay for those perceived atrocities as well as the death of the boy's father. After 49 successful missions, Angel Babe is the Grande Damme of the 918th bomber fleet, and to some like her flight engineer, Sgt. Willets, she even seems to have a soul (and mind) of her own. Her endurance has earned her the label of good-luck charm to the men of the Group. Upon completion of her 50th mission, the Army has decided to retire her from active service and return her to the States for a life of leisure as a recruiting icon. But Angel Babe seems to have other ideas, as she suddenly develops a multitude of mechanical ailments that thwart that final-mission goal. Not only does this strange turn of events recast her as an albatross, it also casts a shadow of suspicion over Willets due to his insistence that she's not ready to withdraw from combat. While touring the States, Major Denver, an exceptional pilot, finds out that his entire crew has been killed in action by anti-aircraft fire over the German occupied city of Liï¿½ge in Belgium. When he returns to the 918th, it is with a burning resolve to exact vengeance against the Nazis at Liï¿½ge for destroying the only "family" he has ever known. Unfortunately, he also seems to harbor a self-destructive inclination arising from a sense of guilt, which Savage infers after a rough flight for Denver and his new crew. Savage decides to ground him, but General Crowe is unconvinced and pressures Savage to put him back into the air for a particularly dicey mission - over Liï¿½ge. Frustrated by heavily overcast skies that make precision bombing impossible, the Allies are at wit's end, until Dr. Rink arrives with a new, top secret technology enabling them to "see" through the clouds: airborne radar. The first missions employing the device are wildly successful, especially since the Germans cannot effectively intercept the bombers with fighters or anti-aircraft because of the cloud cover. Unfortunately, the Germans quickly devise a counter-measure that actually uses the signals from the device to trace the bombers, allowing them to pinpoint the Americans with deadly accuracy. Only Dr. Rink has the knowledge to turn the tables once again, but he is virtually catatonic at the apparent failure of his technology. On a mission to transport two generals with important secret information pertinent to the Normandy invasion, Gallagher's bomber is forced down in the no-man's land between German and Russian battle lines. Hampered by a severely wounded General Stace and his aide, Sgt. Trask, who appears to be afraid of everything including his own shadow, Gallagher hunkers down in a bombed out church until they can make good an escape. Unfortunately, the Germans return to the village, and Gallagher has to find a way to slip past them with the vital info to reach the Russian lines. As part of a brand new strategy called "shuttle bombing", the 918th lands in North Africa at the end of the first leg of the flight seriously short on fuel. Unfortunately, they are forced to use an airfield that has only just been liberated from the Germans by a motley group of Allied units commanded, by chance, by Col. Gallagher's older brother, Preston. Now the Nazis are determined to take the field back in a massive counterattack. Not only are Preston's forces badly outnumbered and out-gunned, but he is suffering from battle fatigue and on the verge of a breakdown. To make matters worse, he has commandeered his brother's fuel for his own plan to retreat, leaving Joe's planes and his mission in grave danger. Having failed to destroy a German U-boat base after multiple attempts, Colonel Hollenbeck is relieved of his command of the 52nd Bomb Group and reassigned to the 918th as General Doud's liaison with the hope he might redeem himself by helping Gallagher knock out the target. However, he uses Gallagher's absence from Archbury to take command of the mission, only to fail yet again. During the attack, Major Stovall spots a U-boat heading for a different destination than their target and leaves formation to investigate, but with his radio out of commission, he fails to hear Hollenbeck's order to return and is subsequently shot down. Now under extreme pressure due to his repeated failures, Hollenbeck tries to divert attention from himself by bringing charges against Stovall. Based on his adjutant's sighting, Gallagher becomes convinced that they have been bombing the wrong location all along, but now he has to prove it and clear Stovall. Thomas Carpenter, a pilot who washed out of flight training and was subsequently dishonorably discharged from the service for insubordination, finds his way to England as a civilian and proceeds to infiltrate the 918th and masquerade as a captain. Desperate for replacements, Gallagher puts him to work as co-pilot on several missions to test his mettle while waiting for confirmation of Carpenter's status that will never come. Carpenter is eager to command his own bomber before his ruse is discovered, but his impatience keeps his evaluator, Capt. Perry, from recommending him. As his veil of lies begins to tear apart, he becomes ever more desperate and willing to do whatever it takes to accomplish his mysterious goal. The 918th gets a bitter taste of its own medicine as the Germans carry out a surprise bombing attack on the base at Archbury. During the raid, Capt. Archer, the Group Chaplain, loses his sweetheart and proceeds to kill a defenseless enemy parachutist, leading him to a serious loss of faith. Meanwhile, another trio of Germans, captured after their plane goes down, hatches a plot to escape and complete their original mission - blow up the Group's ammunition depot. On his final scheduled mission, Major Temple, a good friend of General Savage, is shot down and captured by the Germans along with four of his crew. The commander of the rocket factory that was the target of the raid decides to keep Temple and his cohorts at the facility to dissuade further attacks until he can relocate to a safer site. Because of the importance of the factory, Savage is forced to continue his plan to bomb on schedule, despite the risk to Temple. But thanks to some quick thinking by Temple, Savage is able to devise a risky tactic relying on pinpoint bombing that might spare the captives and still take out the target. While returning from a planning session in Scotland, Col. Gallagher's plane is shot down over the North Sea. He ends up in a rubber raft along with the only other survivor, Capt. Powell, a rich kid who happens to be a pilot Gallagher drummed out of the 918th because of a propensity to avoid danger. Now they wait out efforts by Allied rescue units to find them. Bad luck intervenes, however, and they are picked up by a German U-Boat. Surprisingly, Capt. Wessel, commander of the sub, treats them with gallantry and returns them to the island where he found them. Unfortunately, they soon discover that his intentions were far less than honorable as they become the bait in his trap. Joe Gallagher returns to the storyline of the 918th with a promotion to Major. Wracked by guilt for the death of a friend who took his place on a mission, Gallagher volunteers for a dangerous assignment to support commandos deep behind enemy lines. He also accepts responsibility to notify the intended wife of the dead man, an assignment that may prove even more dangerous as she turns out to be a manipulative schemer bent on snaring him in her web of deceit. The 918th is temporarily reassigned to a newly liberated airbase in Italy which is still perilously close to the battle front as well as a town with some residents who are still loyal to the Germans. The commander of the base, Col. Yates, happens to be a former chief of the 918th who was relieved after a series of brutal, ineffective missions. He has grown lax and allowed security to deteriorate to the point that the Germans are able to inflict serious damage with the help of intelligence from the collaborators in the town. When Gallagher dresses him down and takes charge, Yates retreats to his Italian countess lover for emotional support, without realizing she may be part of the spy ring. Gen. Savage returns from a mission mortally wounded, requiring a delicate operation to remove shrapnel endangering his heart; an operation Dr. Kaiser doesn't feel confident to perform. While waiting for a specialist, Savage is placed in a ward next to Sgt. Aaronson who has just lost his lifetime friend to battle wounds and is also quickly losing his faith in God. Savage tries to talk him out of his closing shell, but the Sergeant slips deeper into melancholy, that is until he meets someone who could use a little of his disappearing faith. On the way back from a mission, a mentor of Joe Gallagher's, Colonel Gus "Pappy" Wexler is flying as an observer. Gallagher asks Fowler to let Wexler fly in the co-pilot seat. They are attacked by ME-109's and Joe is wounded, Pappy takes over calling Gallagher "Bernie". At HQ General Pritchard asks Harvey Stovall's opinion of Wexler. General Britt is away in Washington and if he is not back, Pritchard will be looking for a new Wing Commander. He is thinking of Wexler or Gallagher. Gallagher is on the sick list so Wexler becomes acting Group Commander, and Gallagher the acting Wing Commander. Wexler wants things run by the book. On the next mission, he takes 3 planes and turns too early and aborts. He calls his Bob Fowler, his co-pilot "Bernie", and when Sandy questions him, Wexler orders him to stand down and report to the Flight Surgeon when he is back. Later in the Star & Bottle, the pilots celebrate with Wexler and he makes a good show of it. He arm wrestles Captain Banazek and wins. After another failed air strike, Gen. Savage devises a new tactic: "bombing the leader," i.e. having all his bombardiers drop their explosives where his keenest eyed airman, Lt. Mellon, does. When the tactic wipes out a Dutch school instead of the target, Savage's superior Wiley Crowe balks at letting him try again. Young Mellon admits he was torn up from his best friend's dying on the prior mission, but Savage points to evidence that Luftwaffe flak wiped out Mellon's sight on the second attack. Is Savage just covering his mistake, or giving Mellon and the tactic a deserved second chance ? The Germans have developed a new radar technology that makes their anti-aircraft flak deadly accurate against both night and day bombing operations. Col. Gallagher is tasked with ferrying a British commando team to destroy the radar center, but his plane is shot down shortly after the team jumps, and he and Komansky are forced to parachute to safety and join forces with the Britons. Their brutally efficient methods disturb his sensibilities, but he recognizes the need to subordinate his feelings in favor of protecting the mission. However, as things start going wrong, he and Komansky must step in to salvage the operation. After a grueling series of 21 missions in 30 days, the 918th is finally ordered to stand down for a badly needed 10-day rest. Unfortunately, the order is rescinded almost immediately as the Group is to be included in a force-wide campaign in preparation for a highly classified mission. Hamstrung by the secrecy, Gallagher is forced to order his men back into the skies without explanation or promise of respite. To make matters worse, the 918th is given the ungratifying task of dropping leaflets instead of bombs four times a day for three straight days. As the losses and casualties mount, the morale of the Group collapses into near anarchy, and the men start to take their frustration out on each other, as well as the apparent source of the senselessness - Col. Gallagher. General Savage believes that Gallagher, part of a military family, is too quick to abort missions at the first sign of engine trouble. Savage rides Gallagher hard, assigning him a crew of slackers and misfits and ordering Gallagher to paint the name "Leper Colony" on his plane. Gallagher turns his crew is to an efficient outfit but he despises Savage and wants to do anything to get a transfer. The 918th is being chewed to pieces while attempting to bomb a target in Norway so secret, even Joe Gallagher doesn't know what it is or why it's so important. In fact, in it's latest try, the mission commander, Col. Christie, decides to abort and turn back only 4 minutes from the target after losing 8 out of 21 bombers, with 4 more heavily damaged including his own. Infuriated by the excessive losses and secrecy surrounding the missions, Joe alienates his superiors when he aggressively defends Christie against a looming court martial. To the rescue, possibly, rides his father, Lt. General Gallagher, who is hellbent on getting his son his first general's star. But Joe is in no mood to discuss promotion with his friend and the reputation of the 918th teetering on the edge of oblivion. Gallagher and Komansky, along with critically wounded passenger General Chandler, bail out over a recently liberated Italian island with a small airfield manned by just two African-American soldiers and a handful of German POWs. Komansky is suspicious of Major Luke, the commander of the base, with good reason. Luke turns out to be an AWOL private who doesn't mind serving as long as he doesn't have to shoot anybody. The situation becomes dangerous when a German pilot parachutes onto the island, takes Gen. Chandler prisoner, frees the POWs and radios for help from the Luftwaffe. PS: The Tuskegee Airmen make an appearance. Corporal Lawrence, a mild-mannered desk clerk, stows away aboard a B-17 to try his hand as a gunner and actually turns out to have a good eye. Major Morse, the pilot and group commander when Savage isn't flying, is so impressed, he urges Lawrence to get accelerated training and become a full time crew member. To his dismay, Lawrence balks at the offer, and Morse subsequently learns that he was a conscientious objector before he enlisted. With a distinguished service record and a penchant for driving himself and his crews hard in battle, Morse is infuriated with Lawrence and pressures him to become a combatant. But Morse must also deal with the enormous pressure he has placed on himself as it starts to erode his judgment and cost the lives of more and more men. A German-born U.S. bomber pilot insists on flying until every Nazi is dead or cowering. Colonel Gallagher despises his pilot Major Kurt Brown's disdain for crewmen, and growing fanaticism, but needs Brown's skills, while General Britt wants the Iron Major to head up a division. When Gallagher asks Brown to escort a British flyer's grieving widow home, the increasingly paranoid Brown sees it as a manipulative tactic by his commander. Brown's repressed fears begin to crack his defiant exterior. Due to illness and injury, including his own bum knee, General Savage finds himself short of qualified pilots to lead bombing missions. Help arrives in the person of Major Peter Gray, a highly experienced man with just the right credentials, but also some lingering pains from his own earlier mishap. Complications arise when Savage discovers that Gray's wife, Ann, is his former fiancee and that he still has strong feelings for her. Stressed by the awkward situation, he assigns Gray to command a mission that is supposed to be a milk run, only to discover too late that the Luftwaffe is laying in wait. The mission turns into a slaughter, and though he survives to return, Gray is convinced Savage is trying to get him killed so he can have another chance with Ann. Suffering from fatigue, General Savage is ordered to take leave and decides to pay a visit to sunny Scotland. On his way, he repeatedly bumps into a female British officer, Ann Macrae, who is returning to her home - accidental encounters that become increasingly awkward. Naturally, their animosity slowly turns to grudging tolerance, and then to fondness on the way to true affection. Against his better judgment, Savage finds himself falling in love, and Macrae is caught in the same web. Unfortunately, she is hiding a secret that will cast a terrible shadow over their budding relationship. The Americans resurrect the "shuttle" tactic of bombing a target, flying on to a base on the other side to refuel and re-arm, and then bomb another target on the return flight. This time, however, the turn-around base is in Russia, a determined but wary ally in the war against the Nazis. The situation becomes dangerously complicated when a Russian observer plane, piloted by a highly decorated Soviet hero, is accidentally shot down by one of the American bombers on the first leg of the mission. The suspicious commander of the Russian base refuses to release the supplies Gallagher needs to make the return flight until the man responsible for the act is identified. In the meantime, the Germans have pinpointed the location of the base, and are slaughtering the 918th with waves of air attacks as it sits helplessly on the ground. The situation only becomes more muddled as Gallagher discovers the overzealous shooter was the Soviet liaison who hitched a ride with the Group. After returning from a rough mission, Gen. Savage reacts harshly (possibly on purpose) to a pilot that has cracked under the pressure. Lt. Kerr, a conniving opportunist looking for a way out of the fighting, sees his chance and concocts a scheme to methodically convince his fellow crew members that Savage is also cracking up. As co-pilot, that would leave Kerr free to take control of the Picadilly Lily and fly her to neutral territory, effectively taking them out of the war. Gen. Savage's luck has finally run out. His bomber is shot down over enemy territory and he and three crewmen are captured. They are shipped to a POW camp run by a crack Luftwaffe officer, Col. Max Richter, who has never had a successful escape against his record, as the crowded prisoner cemetery attests. Richter is delighted to see Savage arrive as he looks forward to a lively battle of wits with the renowned American. But this will be a fight to the death, as Richter is quick to use deadly force to protect his unblemished record, and Savage thinks he has the perfect plan to outsmart the cunning German. Thanks to a carefully planned diversion, Savage and several others are able to effect a successful escape from the prison camp, even using Col. Richter as a hostage to make good their getaway. However, their effort to flee Germany takes an ominous turn when Richter is wounded in a shootout with pursuing soldiers. If the escapees leave him behind alive, he will give away their plans, but now he appears to be too badly hurt to travel and Savage's chivalry precludes the most obvious alternative. With a definite strategy in mind, and help from the local underground, Savage must find a way to implement his plan without allowing Richter to become a liability. Col. Gallagher is shot down over Germany, and is captured and severely interrogated by the Nazis. Quite unexpectedly, he is rescued by a group of Germans who have devised an elaborate plan to kill Hitler and seize control of the government for the purpose of negotiating a surrender to the Allies. In order to carry out their plot, however, they will need to convince the Allied leaders of their sincerity and garner support. The leader of the conspirators, Admiral von Kreuter, believes that if Gallagher flies him to England, it will bolster his chances of winning the cooperation he needs. Unfortunately, the Nazis are aware of something afoot, and are rapidly closing in on the scheme. Faced with mounting casualties and aircraft losses, General Savage devises a new tactic for protecting his formations by removing bombs from some of his planes and outfitting them with heavier guns and more ammunition - dubbed Operation Porcupine. Before he can implement the new plan, however, he receives a visit from Senator Johnson, who is not only vehemently biased against the airwar strategy, but also holds a personal animosity toward Savage. Johnson is threatening to campaign to stop all long range bombing, as well as to find any excuse to drag Savage down with it. As if that weren't enough, Savage is also faced with a soldier who is apparently reluctant to marry a British girl who he has put "in the family way". Something nefarious is afoot in the 918th. Stricken by a series of mechanical mishaps that have already cost several planes, Gen. Savage's group is tasked with ferrying a beautiful spy to a parachute drop over Nazi-occupied Poland. Once again, the bomber assigned the mission is struck by gremlins that bring her down with the loss of a popular pilot and co-pilot, but the spy survives for another try. With this latest disaster, tensions between the air crews and ground crews explode into mayhem. But evidence starts to appear that indicates the miscues may not be accidental, and suspicion runs rampant through the base, endangering the spy's mission and the confidence of the troops. On a practice for night mission, they are being tracked by Vendry's unit They change course and evade successfully but "Chub" has to correct as he was off target. Chub is distracted because of his girl Kitty. On the actual night mission into Norway to pick up legendary resistance leader Arn Borg, they are told to look for the King Frederick light. It seems to be a trap as the Germans are waiting. The plane gets shot at lands and picks up Borg who brings his son Christian back with him. Gallagher is angry. Backs at base, Borg's map is impossible to read. Gallagher is ordered to fly another reconnaissance mission. Borg runs away so they decide to take Christian to show them the target. Borg comes back and flies the mission. They bomb what seems to be a heavy water storage facility and the mission is successful. Borg goes back to Norway. Sgt. Komansky lands Col. Gallagher's plane full of wounded crew members after Gallagher is incapacitated with a concussion. Komansky is now up for a Silver Star and a possible promotion. The ambitious Susan Nesbit wants to turn Komansky into a hero to boost her journalistic career. Komansky, an orphan, is having trouble coping with the sudden attention. Things don't get any easier as Komansky and Nesbit began to fall for each other. Employing a new fighter interceptor strategy based on concentration and coordination, the Germans are taking a frightening toll on American bomber operations. To add insult to injury, they taunt the frustrated flyboys with radio broadcasts from a sultry British female turncoat who seems to know almost as much about the mission plans as Allied Command. However, Gallagher devises a plan to turn the German strategy against them, but it requires intelligence information that only a deeply infiltrated spy can provide. Success of Gallagher's plan puts the agent at great risk as the Germans scheme to turn the tables once again. During a lightning strike deep behind German lines, the Americans capture a forward operations base for the Luftwaffe in a small Belgian village that contains a trove of potentially valuable documents. Gallagher and Komansky are sent in to evaluate and retrieve the information, but they have three major problems; their assigned translators have been killed, an enemy survivor has emerged to cause trouble, and the Germans are mounting an all-out counteroffensive to retake the base. One of their problems might be solved by a Belgian boy who speaks German, but he blames the Americans for the destruction of his village and the wounding of his brother. Scotland Yard suspects Gen. Savage of murdering a model, when his lighter is found in her flat and he claims amnesia after being felled in a Luftwaffe raid on London. Savage also seemed pretty bombed himself from his night out, but instead of resting up on base eating bonbons or lawyering up, he returns to Berkeley Square to cooperate with the bobbies. The workaholic fly-boy's stout conscience and fuzzy brain struggle for the truth. The XO, Harvey, and Lieutenant Colonel Rogers, the 918ths acting commander, watch the latest mission come back very chewed up and missing at least 6 six planes. Harvey feels responsible. Sandy hands him a telegram, his son is an MIA. Harvey goes to see General Britt and requests to go back on flying status. He gets an age waiver. Gallagher comes back and is furious with Harvey. He passes his physical by memorizing the eye chart. Gallagher puts Harvey through the wringer but Harvey passes his flight test. On the mission to bomb the marshaling yards at Antwerp, they make the run then get attacked by Bf-109's. Limping home on two engines, Col. Gallagher is trying to reach the English Channel to safely dump his bomb load before landing. Unfortunately, a German fighter attack triggers the bomb release early, with one finding its way onto an occupied French town that is key in helping downed Allied fliers escape to England. The explosion kills the leader of the local resistance group, angering townspeople into cooperating with the Germans. It also injures the son of the leader's daughter, who brings him to England for treatment...and to find the man responsible for the bombing and exact vengeance. The Germans have surrounded a secret atomic research facility with a prison camp full of high profile POWs, believing the Allies will never bomb for fear of a major public relations fiasco. The Americans have an ace up their sleeve, however, in the person of Colonel Harry Connelly, a wizard at pinpoint precision bombing with 43 successful missions under his belt. But, unbeknownst to his comrades, Connelly is feeling the fatigue from so many crucial missions, and his first attempt ends in the very tragedy the Germans had foreseen, causing him to crack under the stress. Gallagher steps in to try again, but he lacks the training and experience Connelly had, foreshadowing a disastrous repeat of the previous effort. Lt. Kane is a dashing young film star who has completed his 25th mission and is ready to rotate back to the States and his movie career, when Gen. Savage, short on crew, asks him to fly one more mission. During the flight, Kane suffers severe burn damage to his face. Confronted with the prospect of suddenly being "ugly", he loses his composure and retreats into a cocoon of self-pity. Savage feels responsible and tries anything to rekindle Kane's confidence, not realizing the true source of his resentment. Lt. Ted Masters, a handsome collegiate sports hero, is assigned to the 918th, along with his mentor, Maj. Praeger, to enhance his image as a symbol of American manhood. However, his brusque introduction, manipulated by Praeger for publicity, rubs the veterans the wrong way, especially Gallagher and seasoned pilot Capt. King. Gallagher assigns Masters to desk duty in an effort to protect him from possible harm in combat, but he chafes at the role and hounds Gallagher into giving him a chance to pilot, much to Praeger's consternation and King's grudging respect. But Gallagher finds him lacking and assigns him to trivial flight duties, forcing the All-American kid to find a way to prove his combat worthiness. Gen. Savage is shot down over the North Sea between England and Nazi-occupied Norway. He manages to make it to a life raft only to find he's sharing it with a downed German fighter pilot, Col Dieter. Savage has an emergency radio and Dieter is wounded, but he has the only gun in the raft, the current is pushing them toward Norway, and Allied search-and-rescue operations are seriously hampered by foul weather. For a few long hours, the war is reduced to its most basic equation, man versus man. When an old flame, who happens to be a member of the French Resistance, shows up in England asking for help, General Crowe concocts a bombing mission to show American support for the Underground movement. Because of the limited strategic value of the target, however, he can't get approval as a stand-alone operation, so he quietly tacks it on as a secondary target to another mission, much to Savage's consternation. The added objective will significantly intensify the danger to his B-17s for a very dubious benefit. Crowe is adamant, but is it because of his belief in the long-term reward, or his devotion to his Parisian lover? An English Lady fights Gen. Savage's mission to bulldoze her ancestral home, to clear the 918th's flight path. After Savage's own bomber almost crashes into the manor house, he confronts Lady Diana directly, but beats a humiliating retreat after her only servant, an old maid, fells him with a broom. The single, always testy commander becomes a jumble of mixed emotions because the never-wed Lady Diana's the last of her line, gorgeous, and housebound with fright as her country defies the constant Luftwaffe blitzkrieg. The 918th is tasked with bombing a strategic target the Germans may be using as a spotter post for artillery that is blocking the Allied advance across France. Gallagher is highly disturbed, however, when he finds out the target is a monastery housing a convent occupied by nuns and refugees. He wrangles permission to personally attempt to sneak into the monastery and convince the civilians to leave before the attack, and has only 24 hours. However he runs into a resistant Reverend Mother (or Mother Superior, the leader of the convent) who refuses to abandon the historic building. Being German herself, the wily German commander cajoles her to stay, convinced the Americans will never bomb the area while she and her charges remain. Meanwhile, the 918th is on its way, ready to bomb the target. Straight from the Pacific, a trio of hotshot fighter aces roar into Archbury field, instantly making a bad impression with Col. Gallagher. Their leader, Capt. Dejohn, a seasoned veteran with a burning desire for combat and little discipline, bristles at his new commander's reprimand, setting the stage for a battle of wills between the two. Things only get worse after Gallagher flies rings around Dejohn in a simulated dogfight in an effort to acclimate him to the differences in the European air war. Dejohn takes the lesson as a personal affront and launches a vendetta against Gallagher. The situation approaches critical as evidence starts to appear that the new pilots arrived at the 918th under very scandalous circumstances. After flying a desk in Washington for the first months of the war, Col. 'Pappy' Hartley, a decorated fighter ace of the First World War, arrives in England. He also happens to be one of Gen. Savage's most revered flight instructors from his training days. With the formation of a new bomb group needing an experienced commander, Savage is only too pleased to recommend Pappy as a candidate for the job. Full of freewheeling fighter pilot blood coursing through his veins, Pappy chafes at the regimentation of bomber duty. Blinded by his admiration for his mentor, Savage wrestles with the growing realization that Pappy is not cut from the right cloth, but is he too late to prevent a calamity? Lt. Bolen returns to the 918th after escaping from a German prison camp where he was brutally interrogated by the Nazi SS for five months. Despite being given the opportunity to return to the States due to his ordeal, he insists on returning to active duty as a pilot and is promoted to the rank of Captain. He also has valuable information about a target that the Allies keep missing, and so he is included in a risky mission to pinpoint the plant for the rest of the Group. While training for the mission, however, the psychological damage from his torture contributes to a midair collision that kills the crew of another bomber and members of his own crew. The guilt of his actions combined with the emotional scars from his internment threaten to destroy his sanity and gravely endanger the vital mission. The tables may be turning in the air war in Europe. The P-51 has arrived, with the promise of providing escort to the B-17s all the way to the heart of Germany. The first 18 are assigned to Gallagher's 918th, but his gunners manage to accidentally shoot one down on the very first mission. This sets a very bad tone between Gallagher and the fighter commander, Col. Troper, who are thrown together to make the new system work. Troper, already an ace with 22 kills, chafes at the need to protect the bombers at the cost of being able to hunt down the Luftwaffe fighters, and his resentment builds to a dangerous and destructive intensity. Returning to his base with vital information about a pending mission, General Savage is forced to take cover from a Luftwaffe bombing raid in the home of an attractive widow with a frivolous attitude and a serious self-esteem issue. As the raid ends, he prepares to resume his trip, only to be blocked by a German airman shot down during the attack. Now he must deal with an enemy bent on escape at any cost and a woman who is not particularly sympathetic to his plight. As precious time ticks away, his bomber group prepares to take off on a mission that, without his information, will be a massacre roughly equivalent to Custer's Last Stand. Army vs. Navy - 1944. The 918th is picked to assist the Navy in an operation to find and destroy a German U-boat wolfpack operating in the Atlantic. Gallagher is concerned to learn that he will be working with and taking orders from Commodore Crompton, an old nemesis of his father. Crompton is even more upset by the arrangement, but grudgingly accepts the pact in order to recharge his failing career. Gallagher becomes incensed when he learns that his planes are not to carry bombs in order to maximize flying time. They are simply to spot the enemy and guide the Navy to the kill. However, the strategy doesn't work quite as planned, and the animosity between Crompton and Gallagher comes to an explosive head. Lt. Josh McGraw, a boyhood friend of Col. Gallagher, arrives at the 918th with his crew and bomber as replacements. Gallagher is glad to see him, but McGraw pulls some reckless stunts because he has always felt overshadowed by Gallagher and wants to make a name for himself. As his exploits grow to ever more dangerous and defiant levels, Gallagher struggles with how to handle his old friend and still get his missions accomplished. But this only seems to inflame McGraw's resentment and rebellious attitude even more. Lt. J.D. Jones is a pilot with a serious problem; with each mission he flies he loses more of his self-confidence and composure. Finally, he causes his bomber to crack up on takeoff, killing or injuring several members of his crew, including his severely wounded co-pilot. His flight engineer, Sgt. Chapman, gets into hot water over black-market trading in weapons, and he needs an alibi. Chapman convinces J.D. to cover for him in return for shifting the blame for the crash on the comatose co-pilot. J.D.'s older brother, Frank, at first protective, becomes disillusioned with J.D.'s deceit to the point of washing his hands of the matter entirely. When Gen. Savage's plane is shot down by a German Trojan horse (a captured B-17) pretending to be a straggler, Joe Gallagher, by now a colonel, takes over temporary command of the 918th. As a reluctant candidate for permanent status, he must face the withering scrutiny of General Britt, as well as his own feelings of inadequacy. As if that's not enough to handle, he also has to deal with Sgt. Komansky, a resentful and defiant former member of Savage's crew, and a burgeoning romance with Mlle. Arnais, a French journalist. And that dreaded Trojan horse is still lurking out there, triggering dangerous suspicion and ready to claim another unsuspecting victim. Every series deserves at least one good spooky episode, and this is it for 12o'H. The Lorelei is a bomber that returns from a mission and lands intact, but with its entire crew dead. Gen. Savage assigns the plane to his new 2nd-in-command, Col. Royce, who he's supposed to evaluate for assignment as a group commander. Royce is a highly-experienced, decorated, and well-liked pilot with one apparent flaw; he's decidedly superstitious, and he's just been handed command of a Flying Dutchman that seems to have a mind of its own. The Twilight Zone visits the 918th. General Savage decides to court martial a pilot, Captain Ritchie, who disobeyed a direct order and left the bomber formation to protect a friend, Lt. Lockridge, and his crew who have bailed out of their crippled B-17. Because everyone else considers Ritchie a hero, Savage's severe action instigates a fall in morale and hostile feelings among his men. Savage must convince his troops that while Ritchie's deed may have saved the lives of the 7 men, it also jeopardized the security of the remaining 200 men in the Group. This is especially difficult for Lockridge, who must weigh his gratitude to his friend against the inescapable reality of Savage's argument. While preparing for a top priority mission, Gen. Savage replaces a sick crewman with a hotshot gunner, only to discover too late that the man has a bad reputation as well as a negative attitude. Joe Waller is a washed-out pilot trainee who takes out his resentment on his fellow crew members. The resulting friction threatens the integrity of the crew, even before Waller is forced to replace the fatally wounded bombardier, making him the most important man in the entire mission. Lt. Wilson, a young, inexperienced fighter pilot, is so eager to get his first kill and fit in with his flying mates that he manages to shoot up Gallagher's plane while chasing an enemy fighter. Gallagher is willing to chalk it up to youthful exuberance and let the matter drop, but Sandy takes it personally and makes Wilson's life miserable. To make up for it, Wilson volunteers for a dangerous mission and ends up saving Gallagher's life at great peril to his own. This makes him an instant hero, especially in Sandy's eyes. It also leaves him craving even more attention, but at what risk. American bombers keep missing an important target in the heart of Germany, but Allied command produces an ace up their sleeve in the form of a German-American GI, Sgt. Reiniger, who knows the area well and can pinpoint the elusive objective - as long as he goes along for the ride. Although his attendance produces the desired result, Reiniger and Gallagher & Crew are forced down at the Russian front, but just a little too close to the German lines where they are captured and interrogated. Now Reiniger becomes a liability as both the Americans and the Germans close in on his closely guarded secret that could get him and Gallagher's men executed. With Allied bombing operations stymied by mysteriously improved German radar capabilities, Col. Gallagher becomes involved with a multi-national, multi-service commando mission aimed at knocking out the enemy facilities and stealing the technology for study. The undertaking is put at grave risk, however, by a combination of poor coordination between the different units involved, Nazi spies, and the reluctant participation of a key expert, Captain Deel, who happens to be a problematic acquaintance of Gallagher's from his past. And now Deel is having a fling with the sister of an important British officer involved in the task who is not at all happy about it. General Savage gets a new bombardier, Lt. Lathrop, a goofy, ungainly kid, who just happens to have a knack for putting the bombs precisely on the target. After Lathrop saves his life, Savage takes a strong interest in the young man and starts pushing him to improve with the goal of acquiring command abilities, but Lathrop is resistant because of his good-natured but naive outlook on life. His rosy world is rocked, however, when he's on the receiving end of a bombardment, resulting in his own personal tragedy that threatens to seriously undermine his dedication to duty. Capt. Bradovich arrives at the 918th as a replacement pilot. He immediately gains a reputation as an arrogant, by-the-book officer who has no interest in making friends or participating in the camaraderie of the Group. His dubious standing is seriously worsened when he is apparently the only survivor after his bomber is shot down. As it becomes harder to find crewmen willing to fly with him, Col. Gallagher must get to the bottom of Bradovich's exclusionary attitude or risk dangerously undermining the morale of his command. While on assignment to the 918th, reporter Clifford Moran is certain that Sgt. Driscoll, an exceptional gunner, is actually an accused murderer who disappeared in the States years before. Desperate for qualified crewmen, General Savage is unconvinced of Moran's allegation and demands concrete proof. In the meantime, Moran continues to hound Driscoll in hopes he'll uncover his charade for a big story and finally goads him into a public confrontation that nearly explodes into violence. Shortly thereafter, Moran mysteriously falls - or is pushed - in front of a subway train, and the circumstances seem to point straight back to Driscoll. Espionage casts a dark shadow across the 918th. The Nazis try psychological warfare by singling out Gen. Savage for assassination and then broadcasting a warning about the plot through radio propaganda with clues on how and when it might happen. The tactic works to a degree as suspicion runs rampant on the base, and the General's ability to do his job effectively is threatened. The question; is it just psychological, or is there really an assassin stalking Savage? Lt. Paul Stiger is a top-notch pilot, and because he comes from a poor background and believes he has a meager future, he is also fearless to the point of being foolhardy. His audacity makes him the perfect candidate for a daring, potentially suicidal mission to bomb a German dam in a solo attack flying nothing more than a P-51 fighter plane. While he accepts the mission with his usual cavalier attitude, a winning lottery ticket makes him a rich man overnight - changing his whole outlook in the process. His new lust for the good life threatens to undermine the heedless courage he'll need to carry out the plan. A pilot's worst nightmare - buried underground with no guarantee of ever seeing the open sky again. Gen. Savage and a group of Londoners are trapped in a cellar during an air raid, while the only man who knows they are there is wounded and incoherent. Savage has to deal with an elderly widow facing true fear for the first time, a young coal miner with a phobia about being buried alive, a charlatan confronted by the lies behind his life, and a girl about to become an unwed mother. Oh, and there is one other occupant of this hell under earth - an unexploded, ticking time bomb. New recruits arrive at the 918th, and one of them, a young gunner with a stellar training record, Cpl. Steve Corbett, is chafing at the bit to get into combat so he can kill some "krauts". On his first training mission, however, he panics when his gun jams, and Sgt. Komansky steps in to settle him down and teach him the ropes, which pleases Col. Gallagher because it is the first time Komansky has shown anything but a "me first" attitude. Unfortunately, Corbett's actions become even more erratic in subsequent missions, leading to the unearthing of a secret that may embarrass the Army Air Corps if it becomes general knowledge. And all of this on the eve of a particularly tricky mission on which Corbett could be a major asset. Savage's elite squadron is picked for a dangerous, top secret bomb run, but his men start to crack waiting for fog to lift over the English Channel, while they are confined to base. One of his best pilots, Lt. Lockridge, is recovering from hepatitis, waiting to complete his 25th mission, which will get him sent back to the U.S. Gen. Savage, the medical officer, and the nurse who loves Lockridge debate: is Lockridge malingering, pretending to be A-OK, or is he too ill to fly on the mission in which 1/3 are expected not to come back from ? General Savage gets a sharp new navigator for the Picadilly Lily, Lt. Kurt Muller, but he starts out a bit cool to his crew-mates' efforts to welcome him into the fraternity. They soon learn why when, quite accidentally, they discover that his father was a member of the American Nazi Party prior to the war. Even Savage is disturbed by this revelation, but he's willing to live with it because of Muller's proficiency. Things get much worse, though, when Muller makes a navigational error that ruins a mission and costs the life of the bombardier. And the situation threatens to explode when it is further revealed that Muller might have been able to save the man's life. The Germans threaten to turn the tide of war back their way with a new super-weapon, a guided rocket bomb capable of devastating vital parts of England. One of the rockets misfires on a test flight and lands in neutral Sweden intact. When the Allies learn that a Swedish underground group has retrieved the rocket, they enlist Gallagher and Komansky to clandestinely fly over to get it. They also procure a British rocket specialist, Group Captain Carmichael, a former RAF fighter pilot. Unfortunately, Carmichael bears a grudge against Americans because he was accidentally shot down by one, ending his flying career. Besides hostility toward Gallagher and Komansky, he also manifests his annoyance by drinking excessively, making him a potentially fatal liability as the team races a group of Nazis with the same goal. Major Parsons has apparently just completed his 25th mission, making him eligible to be rotated back to the States, out of the fighting, something he celebrates with great relish. However, Gallagher has formulated a plan to knock out an exceptionally difficult target, and it requires a pilot with qualifications that match Parson's to a tee. The Major is definitely not inclined to volunteer with a guaranteed return to safety in hand, especially since the assignment has the earmarks of a suicide mission. No amount of persuasion budges him, that is until General Britt discovers a technicality that leaves him at 24 completed missions, instead of 25. Col. Gallagher's plane is shot down, and he parachutes into Switzerland. As a neutral party in the war, the Swiss are obligated to intern Gallagher for the duration, but he has important information about a vital target, and so American agents direct him to the French resistance to get him to the English Channel to safety. However, his escape is complicated by the tag-along of the daughter of one of his contacts who has been shot by the Nazis, and a German deserter trying to evade being executed by his own troops or by the French who still see him as the enemy. The question now is whether the Underground can deliver Gallagher, and whether he can trust everyone who seems to be on his side. Gen. Hoagland, a strictly by-the-book desk jockey, visits the 918th to evaluate Gen. Savage's performance, but he arrives with a headstrong bias because Savage has a reputation for improvised tactics to deal with the randomness of war, as well as an apparent obsession with an especially dangerous target deep within Germany. Sparks fly from the moment Hoagland lands hellbent on getting Savage fired. In an effort to show Hoagland the vagaries of combat, Savage invites him to tag along on a mission. And then the unthinkable; Hoagland is killed in a manner that casts suspicion on Savage. If the looming inquiry is not enough of a distraction, Savage also has to deal with a mentally unstable pilot who has lost confidence in himself and his commander, and may provide information that could cast a very dark shadow on the investigation. The 918th Bombardment Group bombs a target in Wesselhaven, Germany and evade Nazi fighters by flying south into North Africa on the first leg of a shuttle raid. Luftwaffe Colonel Falkenstein, enraged by the American's new tactics, takes four fighters after Col. Joe Gallagher's group. In the meantime, Gallagher's plane has developed engine trouble and is forced to temporarily land in Yugoslavia, hopefully to repair two damaged engines. On the ground after a harrowing landing, Gallagher and his crew are captured by a menacing band of Yugoslavian Partisans. Weather plays havoc with the 918th in their attempts to disrupt German naval operations based in Hamburg, forcing multiple aborts and reducing accuracy even when they can glimpse the target through overcast skies. Badly needed help arrives in the form of a meteorologist from the States with the expertise to more accurately predict weather conditions at the target. As it turns out, the meteorologist turns out to be a rather attractive woman. The combination of Gallagher's views of the weather as an enemy, his sexist condescension to her despite her abilities, and his overactive libido, threaten to undermine her efforts. Her panicked reaction to air combat doesn't help matters much either.

Early in the Spring of 1942 Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union. In the forests of Russia, the partisans try to survive the winter. They have very little to do so.

The district is rampant with the SS and Latvian police. Therefore, they can only survive in the woods. Gregory lives with Dasha and Alena - alone. She withdrew into herself, because in life she had broken all the rules - her husband on the other, whom she loved - was a traitor. A Family Drama that appeals to a mass audience. From the 1960's baby boomers to the rebellious teens of modern day. 1964 is a hard hitting historical story of the Christian family and how their lives were forever changed by a society dealing with the war in Vietnam, the invention of the Main Frame Computer and a world turned upside down by politics, greed and yes, even Hippy Love. The 1967 World Series was won by the heavily favored St. Louis Cardinals, who had won the Series in 1964, in seven games over the stout-hearted resistance of the Boston Red Sox, led by Triple Crown winner 'Carl Yastrzemski' (qv) and American League Cy Young Award winner 'Jim Lonborg' (qv). The seventh and deciding game was won by Hall of Fame pitcher Bob Gibson, who racked up his third win in the Series (and fifth-straight win going back to the '64 Series against the Yankees). Adding insult to injury, the amazing Gibson slugged two home runs in the seventh game, putting an end to the Red Sox's "Impossible Dream" season. The 1975 World Series between the Boston Red Sox of the American League and the Big Red Machine (Cincinnatti Reds) of the National League generally is considered the greatest world's championship match-up in baseball history. The Reds prevailed against the BoSox in seven games, and 'Pete Rose' (qv) was named Most Valuable Player. The 1986 World Series, the 83rd playing of the modern championship series in Major League Baseball, was a memorable battle between the New York Mets, were making their third World Series appearance (last winning it all in 1969) and totaled one-hundred eight regular season wins, and the Boston Red Sox, returned to the Fall Classic after an eleven year hiatus, which helped to spread the legend of "The Curse of the Bambino" to mass public awareness. Great Britain, 1990. The population is now governed by an increasingly corrupt bureaucracy headed by the Home Secretary and backed by the tyrannical Public Control Department (PCD), who have done away with the rights of the individual and maintain control through ID cards, rationing, censorship and electronic/audio/physical surveillance. Free speech is forbidden. The rule of law no longer protects the weak and defenseless. Emigration is impossible. But escape is not, thanks to rebels like Jim Kyle ('Edward Woodward' (qv)), a journalist and secret dissident who battles the forces of the Establishment, but constantly faces imprisonment or death (or worse) at the hands of the PCD and its ruthless controller Herbert Skardon.
null "Necessity is the plea for every infringement of human freedom. It is the argument of tyrants. It is the creed of slaves" (William Pitt). Home Affairs correspondent Jim Kyle, a journalist for one of Britain's three remaining newspapers, provides secret assistance to people trying to escape the repressive regime. His activities continually bring him into contact with the Public Control Department, its tools of bureaucratic repression and its ruthless Controller Herbert Skardon. However, Kyle's current attempts to help a doctor struggling to help his asthmatic daughter leave the United Kingdom may be hampered by Kyle's ambiguous personal relationship with Deputy PCD Controller Delly Lomas. "This is an island prison. Getting us all together is one thing. Getting us out is something else". High-profile political adviser Doctor Sondeberg, a man responsible for the rising fortunes of a variety of presidents, pays a state visit to the United Kingdom on a fact-finding mission to understand the workings of the Public Control Department. However, his motives are far more covert than first appearances. Meanwhile, Dave Brett persuades Kyle to obtain permits to allow them to travel around the country to advance his deal with underworld figure Sammy Calhoun - a deal which involves a motorised caravan as a passport for top academics to flee the oppressive regime of the PCD. "...no barbed-wire, no strait-jackets, no padded cells. After all, this is 1990". When the Public Control Department send union leader Charles Wainwright to the United States of America to promote their cause, the plan backfires disastrously when his speech is littered with dissident criticisms of the bureaucratic nightmare the United Kingdom has become under the stewardship. When he returns home, the PCD are quick to repay the compliment by sending him to an Adult Rehabilitation Centre, a place where offenders against the state (political activists, murderers, thieves, etc) are sent for "correction" under a combination of drug therapy and severe treatments which change their way of thinking. Kyle determines to interview Wainwright and infiltrates the centre, unaware the PCD are ranging their forces against him... "If Kyle can uncover those extortionists where an expert PCD man failed, he is obviously implicated with them." When workers fall prey to an extortionist network collecting money in exchange for their continued silence, Kyle's involvement attracts the attention of PCD controller Skardon, who recognizes an opportunity to eliminate the network and the thorn in his side in one stroke. After the Kyle Trial fiasco, Skardon takes his revenge by turning Kyle into a Non-Citizen: stripping Kyle of his ID and Union cards, freezing his bank account and seizing all his assets. With no home, no car, no job, no money, only the clothes on his back and his family missing (and a bugged Non-Citizen ID card so the PCD can track him), Kyle is forced to wander the streets in what seems like a hopeless attempt to survive, especially when he is constantly and sadistically harassed by Skardon and Inspector Nichols. His only hope is that Dave Brett and black marketeer Sammy Calhoun can find him before his mind and will are permanently broken. "Authorised Systematic Harassment has enormous potential. The slow and noiseless steamroller of the State. The daily brown envelope dropping on the mat". The Public Control Department, in response to more dissident remarks printed in the underground press from Kyle and Tony Doran, devise a plan to turn the heat up on the pair by employing a systematic campaign of Authorised Systematic Harrassment (ASH). Using all the bureaucratic mechanisms at his disposal, Skardon launches a tirade of officialdom against both men, which succeeds in pushing Doran and his wife to breaking-point. There's good news and bad news in Britain. The good news: Home Secretary Dan Mellor has been replaced by Kate Smith, and a "pentagon" - one of a growing army of dissident groups - is preparing to take on the hatred PCD. The bad news: the PCD's new Deputy Controller is Lynn Blake, Jim Kyle's former romantic interest, and her first job is the exposure of "Faceless", Kyle's source within the PCD. "This mate of yours is a shark. With his jaws into whole cargoes. Petrol. Fags. Booze. Grub. It's up to us to nanny him?". When food available in the supermarkets steadily evaporates, Kate Smith's government turns their attention to black marketeers profiting from illicit supplies. Ministry of Food MP Peter Greville feeds Kyle information about the matter, but soon both he and his family become the focus of suspicion from the Public Control Department. "Who are we out to nail? Careguard, the Home Secretary or Skardon and the PCD?" Jim Kyle is in trouble - he has fallen into the hands of Police Commissioner Hallam. The question is, will Hallam hand Kyle over to the PCD or is Hallam working on his own? "The age of the common man seems to be degenerating into the age of the common denominator". When the Public Control Department take steps to shut down an underground newspaper peddling dissident stories critical of the regime, Kyle provides assistance to its publisher, Avery, in a bid to prevent their interference. "We always said there'd be Peace Crimes Trials one day ... We're winning now. There'll have to be a purge of the PCD soon." The dissident assault on the Public Control Department has been successful, but the public suicide of a cell member has resulted in world condemnation of Britain's policies and the PCD being plunged into bitter in-fighting. Have Kyle and the dissidents finally won? Will Skardon and the PCD fall for good, and if they do will the cure prove worse than the disease? The Ombudsman's Court supposedly exists to hear and review appeals by citizens and consists of a tribunal of judges, but every appeal is rejected despite the legitimacy of the claim. However, one judge, Philip Carter, is determined to fight the corrupt legal system and continually votes to uphold legitimate claims despite always being outvoted by the Chairperson and a weak-willed third judge. Angered by Carter's defiance, the Attorney General demands that Skardon and the PCD find a way to silence Carter. The PCD's plan: a campaign of threats and intimidation against Carter's pregnant wife, who has already miscarried twice. With the help of an American news colleague, Kyle tries to find a way to help the Carters, but the PCD's sadistic Inspector Jones may have already struck too hard at Mrs. Carter. "We don't make laws, we only carry them out". Despite the Home Secretary's abolition of all exit visa appeals, Kyle successfully helps Doctor Vickers leave the United Kingdom, but without his wife and daughter. Dr. Vickers invests his hopes in the international law which states that his family can join him one month later, provided he can attain residency status in another country. However, the Public Control Department are determined to seal up any possible legal loopholes to block Vickers' efforts and in so doing put an end to Kyle's interference - permanently. Dr. Alan Vickers, whom Kyle and Breet helped escape, has been campaigning throughout the United States to get public and world opinion to force the PCD to let his wife and daughter emigrate. The problem is that in his speeches he may have let clues drop that may lead Skardon and the PCD to Kyle. When the PCD go after Kyle's family and a plot to frame Kyle blows up in the PCD's face, Delly Lomas goes to America to persuade Dr. Vickers to return to England to testify against Kyle in return for exit visas for his wife and daughter. Soon Kyle finds himself on trial with the man he helped as the main witness against him ... "Kyle'll be back to normal in about an hour. Until then he'll probably show an amusing tendency to tell the truth." Groups of dissidents, once-divided in their opposition to the Public Control Department, are putting aside their differences in a bid to bring down the bureaucratic machine in a consolidated movement. Meanwhile, Skardon increases his pursuit of Kyle, whom he believes he can break and thereby shatter the plans of the opposition.

Eventually Mark learns of what happened at the Embassy and informs the President and urges him to order an assault to take Jack out. But he wants to talk to him first and does.

They learn that the person is Margo's daughter, Simone. They go to the hospital to talk to her. Margo upon learning what happened to Simone sends someone to find out if she revealed anything. Jack asks the doctor to wake her up so they can question her. Kate talks to the girl Simone was chasing and learns that Simone is married to her uncle and that she killed her mother.

He informs Jack that he contacted Margo and agreed to surrender himself and wants Jack to help him get to the location where they agreed. Jack tells Kate what's happening and tells her she needs to get what they need from Simone. So Kate "tells" the doctor to wake her up even though it's risky. She wakes up but says that Margo is probably gone and on the move that's when she convulses. The President makes the arrangements and says "goodbye" to Audrey. The man Navarro sent to take care of Jordan calls and says that his body hasn't turned up. Navarro tells him to find him and make sure he's done.

He then calls the President who informs Jack of what happened; that one of their subs attack a Chinese vessel. So it seems like Cheng is trying to get the U.S. and China into a conflict. Jack wonders how the men who attacked him, whom they learn are Russians, found him and he learns it was Boudreau. He goes to confront him who admits that he tried to turn Jack over to the Russians. They learn that Cheng is working for the Russians who wants the conflict to occur. So he decides to use Mark to help him find Cheng.

Rona attends her old Catholic school to drum up trade for the catering business,lying to an old school-mate about being a respectable charity worker. When the formidable Sister Virtue tells her that liars will burn in Hell she fears she may have unleashed a curse. And she is right. A man dressed as a giant badger to advertise a pet shop has his car stolen from outside the Porters' house and when he arrives at the door it so flusters Ben he accidentally kills the goldfish. Ben's hears that his biggest rival in the plumbing trade,Jake the Klingon,has died and with no family has charged Ben with being the executor of his will and planning a lavish funeral with a Star Trek theme. At the same time Bill gets a visit from a health inspector who tells her that her kitchen is not up to standard so she and Rona go to see personal banker Dawn,who - in her irritating sing-song voice - once more tells Bill that no loan will be forthcoming. After a disastrous funeral Ben learns that Jake is actually alive and had made the demands to humiliate him. He decides that the family needs a holiday and,putting the Chevy up as collateral,books a flight to Miami. Already bored with her new job Bill also has to look after Ben,down with flu,and has taken in next door's dog,the elderly and flatulent Bonzo. When Bonzo falls ill rather than let him suffer Bill puts him out of his misery with Ben's tablets. Ben is shocked that his wife went behind his back to put Bonzo down and,given that he is also ill,asks whether she would do the same for him. The whole episode brings out a morbid curiosity with death in David,who gives his teddy bear a ritual burial in the back garden. Rona is preparing for her wedding to Gordon and the Porters' house is in chaos as Auntie Pearl takes charge. David complains of feeling ill and he and Ben escape to sit in the car whilst Bill goes to see Rona. Through the kitchen window she sees her friend,in her bridal dress,dangling from the ceiling - Rona was changing a light bulb when the ladder fell away. Bill tries to help her by crawling in through a cat flap but gets stuck and eventually both women are rescued by a door-to-door salesman. On returning home Bill finds David has collapsed and Rona lets the Porters take him in her wedding car to the hospital where Dr Brook tells them that the boy has tetanus. On Hallowe'en a social worker approves the Porters fostering Declan but tells Bill he has an uncle,Lon,whom he has never heard of. Bill and Ben visit him at the cemetery lodge where he lives and note he has a lot of facial whiskers. When Lon tells Ben that there is a 'curse of the Porters' Ben fears the worst and assumes that the male members of the family are all likely to become werewolves. However,on opening the box of family photos given him by Lon he discovers that in fact he is Jewish. Bill is laid up with flu,aware that the household cannot function without her and biding her time by listening in on Jenny's phone calls and spying on Rona in her renewed attempt to get pregnant by Tony - which results in a paranoid Rona believing Tony's ex-wife is stalking him. Ben is looking after Snowball, the Grimes' cat, whilst they are on holiday and ends up crossing town and getting very dirty and dishevelled in pursuit of the wandering feline. He gets it back to the house - but is it Snowball? And if not why is a muffled mewing coming from somewhere in the newly decorated kitchen? Bill is feeling harassed again and Ben is no help with his frequent visits to his work-shop. Stressed out by work at the bakery and her efforts to pass her driving test she misses the signs when an unhappy Jenny splits with her boyfriend. Fortunately Rona is on hand to cheer Jenny up with her considerable experiences with men whilst Ben takes Bill bowling. However Bill is shocked to find that Ben has blown his rebate on a 1960 Chevrolet,not the best vehicle in which to take her test after being used to an Austin. On a Saturday afternoon Jenny comes into the house evidently upset and it becomes apparent that something has happened between herself and Clive. Bill and Rona compete with Ben and David to find out what has happened,Bill ringing Laura to discover that Clive is going to buy a ring. Bill assumes that he is buying Jenny an engagement ring against her wishes but when the family arrives at the shop they find that the ring is for Clive's recent piercing. Declan is staying with the Porters when Bette pays a surprise visit and angers Bill by her indulgence of the little boy. Bill and Ben are anxious to get rid of Bette when she lets slip that often,when staying away from home,she has a nightmare about something white,large and terrifying though they are unclear as to what it exactly takes the form of. Ben decides to put it to the test by dangling a large white rabbit in white Y-fronts through a hatch into Bette's bedroom,but it fails to do the trick. Declan's rendition of 'Walking in the Air' from 'The Snow-Man' on the other hand,hits the spot. Bill is upset when she learns that the other family members have put the porters forward as subjects for a fly-on-the-wall television documentary as she fears it could harm their application to foster Declan. She thus goes out of the way when the crew arrives to put them off the idea of using the Porters,sending Ben on a silly wild goose chase 'emergency ' call and serving unpalatable food. Eventually she gets her way though the Porters are shocked to find that the family chosen to replace them,the Bakers, are just like them with similar names and a neighbour called Rhoda. Bill believes her brush with fame is over but had reckoned without Ben putting the house forward for 'Changing Rooms'. In an attempt to make the family enjoy quality time together Bill takes out the fuse wire and puts in in a self-addressed envelope in a pillar box. With no television,radio or computer the family is really bored and a game of Charades only ends up with them talking about television shows. Bill's efforts to get Rona to help her retrieve the envelope causes a misunderstanding with Mr and Mrs Grimes - who get an even bigger shock when Ben,after groping for a light in his darkened attic,ends up in their bedroom. Bill receives a chain letter threatening bad luck if not sent on to others. Against Ben's advice she rips it up but then bad things happen. The builders are involved in a road accident,a client dies,David loses his trunks at the swimming pool and Bill falls out with Rona after accusing her of sending the letter. Eventually the newly-divorced Tina arrives and confesses to sending the letter as she was feeling down and knew that sensible Bill would tear it up as she did not believe in superstition. However Ben is about to make a parachute jump and the woman race to the air base to ensure his safety - only for a different sort of calamity to happen. The new kitchen is now complete but Bill is too busy working to listen to Jenny,worried that her performance at the school concert will be overshadowed by the buxom Charlene and her Madonna impression. Fortunately Ben and David come to her rescue as the trio wow the audience with their Blues Brothers number. Bill meanwhile goes to visit Rona and finds two escaped snakes in the living-room. With Tony worn out by Rona and asleep upstairs the two women are trapped against the wall until Bill looks out of the window and sees that her house is on fire. She takes drastic action to escape into the street. Unlike the rest of the family Bill is opposed to the National Lottery and only wants to do her paperwork whilst the rest of the Porters watch the live draw and speculate on what they would do with their winnings. She suddenly realizes that she must have washed Ben's jeans without taking the ticket out of the pocket and rushes off with Rona to buy a replacement - which inadvertently causes Clive's parents to get arrested. It seems that Christine actually had Ben's ticket all along but Bill gets a shock when she hears the numbers called. Bill is concerned that David's interest in death is not helped by Ben,who,on his way to the school parents' evening,imagines himself to be the Terminator and cuts up a Ford Escort. Discovering that the driver is disabled he feels ashamed but later accepts a challenge to race him - and loses. Bill fears that she may be pregnant again and buys a home testing kit but when one of the testers goes missing and Jenny acts oddly it looks as if Jenny is the one who is expecting. Rona has a talk with her and discovers she is bulimic whilst Ben,who actually took the test for a laugh,finds that he tested as being pregnant. Now unemployed Bill is late for her appointment signing on thanks to a phone call from Bette and the car breaks down on the way to the DHSS office. She gets a mechanic to fix it but he is whisked away by Anneka Rice for her 'Challenge Anneka' television show and Bill gets pulled over by the police pushing the car through a red light. Finally she makes her appointment to be interviewed by the infantile Janice but eventually agrees to take a job with Rona at a factory supplying catering packs. Ben meanwhile takes on an assistant,the abrasive Christine,who soon falls out with an arrogant woman customer. Back home after her trying day Bill falls asleep on the settee,missing the local TV news bulletin which reports Angelo's death in a road accident. Harassed Bill Porter juggles working in a bakery with her sex-mad friend Rona with looking after lazy husband Ben, a plumber and their children Jenny and David. Bill is called to Jenny's school where the headmaster - in costume for a Gilbert and Sullivan show - tells her that Jenny has been truanting. It turns out that Jenny has been seeing a biker called Spin. However Bill herself keeps running into - literally - an attractive biker,Angelo,who suggests they go away together. She declines as her family comes first and feels it would be hypocritical to chastise Jenny in the circumstances. Bill's mother Bette comes on one of her dreaded visits,bringing Jenny a taffeta dress and a video nasty for David. To their annoyance Bill and Ben are ordered out of their bedroom and when Bill comes home from work early she discovers why. Bette is in bed with an old flame. After the initial row the two women have a heart-to-heart with Bill wondering if she is turning into her mother. Whilst the prospect of eloping with Angelo again comes up Ben finds his latest customer is a former girlfriend. Tired of being taken for granted by the family Bill agrees to spend a weekend in Scotland with old flame Malcolm,now a big name in Hollywood. Rona covers for her,saying that she is staying with a former school-friend but Ben,watching a golf tournament in Scotland on television,sees Bill and Malcolm in the crowd. He tracks them down and travels to their hotel in Scotland,head-butting Malcolm. Then Malcolm's wife turns up and Bill,unaware that he was married,pushes Malcolm into a fountain. On Bank Holiday Monday Bill is looking forward to hosting Clive,Laura and Laura's German mother Sophie. Unfortunately Bette pays a surprise visit with her talk of VE Day street parties and The Sound of Music video and when Rona brings Pearl in to divert her the pair do nothing but talk about the Blitz. Fortunately both are shuffled off to Rona's before Sophie arrives and,apart from Christine dressing as Hitler for the street party, the whole day goes swimmingly. Of course the women had reckoned without Ben's clumsy attempts to mend the bedroom wall... Whilst Rona spends Christmas alone,all her ex-boyfriends being otherwise engaged, the Porters spend the season with Bette and they hate it, Bill recalls painful childhood Christmas times whilst Ben imagines himself in a scene from 'Misery' with Bette breaking his legs and tying him to a bed to make him stay at her house. They have to watch TV shows they hate,play Consequences - which only David finds funny - and suffer the heating on full blast. Bill tries to explain to her mother her feelings but things start to look up when Bette,hypnotized by the tree lights,falls into a trance. As the titles roll the cast perform Christmas songs. Tina tells Ben that their estranged father Frank is coming home from Thailand but when Bill and Ben go to meet him are amazed to find that he has a much younger Thai bride Darrani. Ben argues with Frank over his constant absenteeism and the Porters leave but Rona persuades Bill,Darrani and Tina to go with her to see a male stripper. Even though he is masked Rona recognizes him when he is fully frontally nude as Gordon,an ex-boyfriend,who invites the women backstage,Tina's prim persona taking a knock. In the meantime Frank comes to see Ben and apologizes leading to a reconciliation, and bringing a magic set which wins the children over. Bill arrives home very late to find the others waiting up for her. Jenny thinks she has got her A-level results but it is a prank played on her by David so she gets her own back,leaving him with his hair dyed bright green. Rona asks Bill to entertain an old friend but when the woman turns up she witnesses a row when Bill accuses Ben of spending the family's holiday money on a replica of Lady Penelope's car from 'Thunderbirds'. In the event the friend rings to say she was unable to turn up and the woman turns out to be from Social Services,vetting Rona's adoption suitability and concluding she is too old. At least Jenny finds her actual exam results in Harry's basket and found she has passed to go to university. On Christmas Eve Ben surprises the others by explaining that he has not bought a turkey as he has won a pig in a raffle. Unfortunately it is very much alive and extremely aggressive,soon eating the family out of house and home. They take it to a farm in the country to join other pigs but it refuses to get out of the van and in desperation Bill phones Battersea Dog's Home. Christine appears and agrees to take the pig but by this time it has given birth to a litter. The cast celebrates with a rendition of 'Rootin' Tootin' Santa Claus'. On Christmas Eve - having ended up with four trees - Bill is amazed when the message 'Is That You,Bill?' appears on David's computer and cannot be switched off. In reply to cryptic messages Bill cripples the country's television transmission and causes bad weather,discovering to her horror that she has the power to make anything she wants happen. After Rona has got in on the act by summoning three scantily-clad and extremely puzzled young marines it suddenly dawns on the family who the 'Bill' is whose wires have inadvertently crossed with David's computer. Before anything else can happen the family flees to a French chateau for a rendition of the song Relaxez-Vous. Bill is fed up as Ben is too tired for sex and keeps nodding off whilst watching television, noone helps with the housework and she confides in Rona her feelings for Angelo the biker. Ben decides that as a break for Bill they have Sunday dinner at his sister Tina's house but Tina's husband drags Ben off to the pub leaving the women to do the cooking and Bill has a row with Tina, who accuses her of being a bad parent by going out to work and hitting David for bringing his pet rat into the house. Bill drives off in anger, only to realize she cannot technically drive. Fortunately Angelo appears and guides her home. David is hoping his parents will come and see him in his school drama performance and they promise to be there but.... Ben,as retaliation for sending Jake the Klingon on a wild goose chase,is knocked unconscious and wakes up in Port Meirion,the village used as the location for TV show 'The Prisoner' and has to escape a giant white ball. Bill and Rona break into potential premises and find it is where singer Shirley Bassey stores her stage gowns. They dress up and Camcorder each other. Needless to say they miss David's performance though he does win and Shirley Bassey also rings to ask Bill if she wants the Camcorder back. Jenny comes home for the week-end with new boyfriend Keith. Bill is quite happy that they sleep together but Ben is disapproving and plans to wear Keith out before he can do anything. This takes the form of getting him to help Ben lay the floor tiles at Bill and Rona's new catering centre and also by getting him to push home a piano Ben has recently bought with Ben,feigning a twisted ankle,sitting on top of it. However the piano rolls down a hill and Ben genuinely ends up in casualty. Declan is mistakenly accused of shop-lifting and the police escort him to Bill and Rona's catering centre,only to find the two women have been accidentally inhaling the tiling adhesive and are high on solvents. Rona takes the bus to her wedding and gets into conversation with a garrulous old lady,Peggy. The more Peggy talks to her the more Rona feels she should not be getting married and,on arrival at the church,finds so many of her ex-boyfriends in the congregation that she cannot go through with it and runs out on Gordon. David meanwhile lies unconscious,Bill blaming herself for not listening when he said he was ill and Ben feeling guilty for not taking him for his tetanus shot. David imagines that Angelo appears to him telling him it is his decision whether to live or die but after Ben has told his comatose son how loved he is David regains consciousness and throws up on his father. The Porters get a phone call from Mr and Mrs Grimes on holiday in Switzerland and discover they have offered to look after something in the couple's absence. Seeing all the Grimes' koi fish have died involves a mercy dash to Reading where Tina has bought replacements from a specialised pet shop with Rona and Tony stalling the Grimes on their return from the airport. Fortunately Bill and Ben have managed to fool the old couple that their fish were alive and unwell. Sadly they forgot about the racing pigeons. Ben and Bill drop Jenny off at university,Ben being shocked to find his daughter has a connecting room to Keith,a boy who seems not to wear clothes. On the way home a gang of children rob Ben's van and he catches one of them,ten-year old Declan,who escapes but later tracks the family down and returns some of the stolen items. Declan tells them that he is homeless and his mother abandoned him so soft-hearted Bill lets him stay over,with a view to giving him a permanent home. Next day the Porters find they have been burgled and Declan has disappeared though he soon turns up again . He had only gone to get his belongings and tells Ben the burglars located him through his business card. Declan manages to get all the items back,though Jenny is surprised to find they have been dumped in her room. The Porters welcome David's Italian pen-friend Fabrizio,a handsome ladies' man who charms Rona but annoys Ben by hogging the settee and borrowing his car without asking. Soon Bill is also angry when Fabrizio - who has a string of credit cards - encourages David to spend his savings and she gives him a piece of her mind. However Ben has discovered that Fabrizio's father is a feared Mafia don and,when dark-suited men bearing violin cases,knock on the door he and Bill and David decide to hide from them. Too bad they failed to stay around to find out that are merely waiters and musicians engaged by Fabrizio to say Thank You for the hospitality shown him. On Hallowe'en Bill dismisses the supernatural as ignorant suspicion. However,when a foreign-accented gentleman delivers what appears to be a coffin to Mrs Curdaal from next door,she has second thoughts,particularly when a bat flies into the bathroom and,after seeing a sinister figure at Mrs Curdaal's house she realizes the name is an anagram of Dracula. Furthermore the lady is not answering her phone. The Porters and Rona take appropriate action using garlic and a huge crucifix,only to find there is a rational explanation for their fears - or is there? Bill is left a heavy antique wardrobe and its content, a mink coat,by a deceased aunt. Though opposed in principle to fur coats she cannot resist trying it on but when Jenny comes in she hides in the wardrobe - which is promptly taken to an auction. Bill manages to escape but walks straight into an anti-fur demonstration headed by Jenny. Ben,suffering from menopausal depression,goes missing whilst Rona,disappointed to learn that her pregnancy symptoms are actually diabetes,finds an abandoned baby in the hospital grounds. To the annoyance of Jake the Klingon - now a member of the Thunderbirds Society - Ben receives the Purple Plug on his windscreen,inviting him to become a member of the Brotherhood of the Plunger,the masonic society for plumbers though he has to perform some bizarre public rituals to show that he is worthy. The rest of the family believe the whole thing is a wind-up engineered by Jake so that when Ben goes for his initiation ceremony he dowses the Grand Master in fire-fighting foam and shows his contempt for the supposed prank. Unfortunately the Brotherhood is all too real and are not happy with Ben. Declan is now officially part of the family but with the Millennium approaching Ben annoys Bill by panic buying as he believes that a computer failure will cause a shortage of power. On New Year's Eve Tina arrives for the family gathering and reports a gas leak but the workmen mending it cut through an electric cable,causing a power cut . Switching on the radio whilst huddled in the dark the family hears that an unexploded bomb has been unearthed in the street. With Rona announcing that she is pregnant this is a New Year's Eve to remember,especially when the source of the supposed gas leak is discovered. The house is in chaos - builders are still modifying the kitchen to the health inspector's standard and David is running a sideline in providing cockroaches to school-friends. At least Jenny is happy with new boyfriend Clive,whose parents,Laura and Harry,invite Bill and Ben for dinner. The evening goes well - until the Porters find that they have accidentally brought some of David's cockroaches with them. Next day Harry and Laura pay a surprise visit - and discover Bill and Ben trying to stab a massive inflatable pope which Ben picked up at a boot sale and will not deflate itself. Cleaning David's cluttered room Bill discovers his secret diary which recounts past events in the Porters' lives - how Bill,setting up her own catering business with Rona,almost came to blows with a prostitute after putting a card in a newsagent's window,how Bette's sister Belle locked herself in her flat refusing to come out for Bill or soppy social worker Mo until Bette came round to patch up a long-running family feud and how Rona's gay brother visited,taking a shine to Ben as he liked fat men,Rona eventually forgiving Adam for stealing one of her boy-friends. Ultimately Bill discovers the real secret hidden in the cupboard with her son's diary - and it is scary. Ben gets a camcorder to film the family with a view to sending a video to 'You've Been Framed' but Bill,sick of her job and having learnt about Angelo,is not in the mood. The kids' attitude does not help so Bill reverses the roles by putting them in charge and then disobeying them. She goes for a job interview with another bakery,loses her shoe on the bus and gets caught in the rain. However on arriving at the interview she is confronted by a nude man who thinks he is a dog after having a breakdown on being told he is being made redundant. A nurse leads him away and Bill is told there is no job. Back home she and Rona learn that they too have been made redundant as the factory goes into liquidation. Despite his discovery that Rona is well-known to all the men in the bar they go to Gordon asks her to marry him and she asks Bill to cater for the wedding. Whilst out shopping Ben meets a female market researcher,who,deciding that the Porters are a typical family,gives him a box of foodstuffs to sample. Most of them are unpopular but,to Bill's annoyance,Ben,Jenny and David cannot stop stuffing themselves with 'Drool' chocolate bars to the extent that next morning they are too full for breakfast but are still anxious for more Drool bars so Ben returns to the precinct to ask for some. However the market researcher tells him that they have been withdrawn from circulation for being psychologically addictive and potentially harmful. Back at the house the Porters find Rona busily searching for the bars. Bill is considered mean when she refuses to allow the family to have a dog so,to get her used to the idea,they pretend to have an invisible dog,whom they call Harry. Bill is roped into walking him which gets her some funny looks,but on returning home finds an actual dog in the lounge. He turns out to be a guide dog called Barry,or so it was thought but after he has guided his owner into the path of Ben's van,the real Barry is discovered and the Porters have their own dog at last. Since Rona has omitted to tell the council,who own her house,that her mother,the named tenant,has been dead for eleven years,Rona is informed that the council are planning to sell the house. However,if she can supply a birth certificate proving she is her mother's daughter she can stay in the property. As Rona cannot find the document Ben suggests holding a sï¿½ance to get in touch with her mother who can tell them where it is. The sï¿½ance is not a success but Rona does get to know who her mother is - Auntie Pearl. Tina is going on a two-week Mediterranean cruise for Christmas so the Porters drive her to Southampton docks,where Ben crashes into the captain's car and the crew's van. Bill,Ben,Rona and David go on board to see her off but discover that the ship has sailed before they can disembark. Whilst they hide Tina tries to sneak them meals but is side-tracked when elderly lecher Fletcher takes a shine to her so Ben dresses as a waiter to steal food but ends up serving the captain's table. Rona finds herself on stage with the ship's dance troupe whilst Fletcher transfers his attentions to a disguised Bill. Finally they are put ashore - in a life-boat, in time for the finale song, 'Be Kind To Your Parents'. Whilst perusing magazines with Bill for work purposes Rona comes across Psychic Sadie's horoscopes,which tell her that something unpleasant will happen to her. Bill is cynical but then they get a call to visit Aunt Belle who is not opening the door to visitors to her high rise flat. In fact she is stuck on a ledge,having gone out to feed the pigeons but fear that she will be put in a home if the authorities are called so Bill and Rona go out to save her - and get stuck themselves. Fortunately they are saved by a lift repair man but Bill eventually has to agree that Psychic Sadie got one of her predictions right. After their lottery win Bill and Rona are keen to find new premises but Bill is worried when Jenny tells her that David stayed out all night and they find a piece of paper with the name Bunty Manson on it. When Bill and Rona phone Bunty's number an older woman answers and David is plainly in the background. Bill and Ben follow him,only to find that the older woman is coaching him for an acting part in the school play. Their minds are now at rest but due to a faulty lift Bill and Ben accidentally find themselves in a wardrobe in a removals van. Jenny is now at university and David has a strange Goth girlfriend Maxine with psychic powers,who prophesies a strange visitor. And she is right. Bette tells Bill that her late husband was not cremated but put in cryogenic suspension in a warehouse in Bermondsey. Unfortunately on arrival the family finds the warehouse is closing down and they have to keep the coffin overnight at their house before another company can remove it. There are strange noises to be heard whilst,even when the body has been collected,another of Maxine's predictions comes true. Ben's team Spurs are on a losing streak and must win their last three games to avoid relegation. Despite Bill having given Ben's 'lucky' underpants to the charity shop the team wins so Ben insists that on the next match day everybody behaves exactly the same as they did on the previous Saturday - including Jenny and Clive splitting up as she is going to university. He is so confident he places a bet to say that if Spurs lose the family will dress as the Spice Girls and sing in public. Come the final Saturday Jenny and Clive decide not to split after all,the team loses and the forfeit has to be paid. Late at night Bill and Ben see a car speeding away from the house next door. Believing that Leonard and Dora Grimes are away on holiday Bill assumes that burglars have been at work and phones the police with the car's registration number. No police turn up though the Porters sit up all night,Bill reporting the car's number to a local radio phone-in.Next day the radio broadcasts the news that a car with that number plate,belonging to television repair men has been besieged and attacked. They go back to bed unaware that the grimes have been robbed and tied up all night. Ben is concerned when he has to visit the tax inspector but is delighted to find he has been granted a rebate. Bill goes to the supermarket to shop for Ben's barbecue but,after giving chase to a thief,is mistakenly arrested herself. However seeing Angelo on the CCTV system she is given the strength to stand up to the rude store detective and is allowed to go. The barbecue is nonetheless a disaster,leading Jenny to declare that she is going to be a vegetarian whilst Bill and Rona phone a number left on Ben's van,which they hope will be Angelo but it is only one of Ben's clients. The Porters are enjoying their holiday at Key West when they see on the Weather Channel that Hurricane Bill is approaching so they flee to Miami,staying in a cramped motel full of other hurricane refugees. When the power goes down they expect the worst and spend the night huddled in a cupboard,where Jenny announces that she and Jason are engaged. Next morning the family emerges to discover that the hurricane changed course and missed Miami completely. Back home Rona's attempts to seduce Tony lead to his telling her that he does not want to father a child but is happy to be her boyfriend. Bill and Rona are catering for a wedding reception and Jenny agrees to help but,having just split with Jason,she is depressed and careless and drops things. Christine also assists but is short-tempered and abrasive as ever. Rona has good luck though when she spots the handsome DJ Tony and decides he is going to be the father of her child. Tina crashes in,upset as she suspects Brian of having an affair. Bill rings the mysterious number on his mobile phone and speaks to the other woman but lies to Tina to spare her feelings. However Tina soon learns the truth. Jenny gets back with Jason but Bill's trying day does not end when she gets home and finds Ben,locked out of the house after forgetting his key,has taken out the bedroom window. Bill despairs as she learns from the fireman that the blaze was caused by faulty wiring and surveys her gutted house. Rona lets the Porters stay with her and also persuades Tony not to move out - by imprisoning him in the fold-up bed. Bette turns up with a skip,personifying the spirit of the Blitz as she oversees the house's refurbishment,leading to the Porters admiring their newly decorated home. After Ben's spending the rebate on the car money is tight. Bill's seedy boss Rory Castell will not give her an advance and her grinning personal banker Dawn refuses a loan. Whilst parked at the bank she gets boxed in and again Angelo comes to rescue her. She goes to visit the family of a boy who has befriended David and seeing that they live on a poor housing estate comes to count her blessings whilst Ben's efforts to teach David the facts of life with a girlie magazine fail as David knows them already. After Castell makes slimy advances to Bill and Rona they persuade him to strip and leave him tied up in the bakery,giving their notice. When Bill tells Ben she is jobless he offers to sell the car but she sees how much it means to him and dissuades him. 3 Day Weekend brings viewers the luxurious spas, beautiful bed and breakfasts, historical sites and breathtaking scenery that make the South unique. 3 Day Weekend is the definitive guide on where to go, where to stay, and what to do for the most fun, relaxation and great memories a long weekend can offer.

null What is it to be a superstar? We suspect it's not at all what you think it is. All of us, at some time or another, come to a point our lives where we need to choose what path to go down. In many respects its like standing in front of a bridge - a bridge in life sort-of-speak. But if your goal in crossing that bridge is to become a superstar on the other side, you're going to find that in crossing it you're going to be on your own; that none of your friends are going to dare to go with you; and that when you get to the other side you're going to lose control and the only thing you will know, is that everything you know will do you no good from thereon. Everything on the other side of that bridge is new, and the choice is yours to make your world beautiful . . . or to make it crap. The choice is yours and yours alone. Our story follows the journeys of three different musical groups as they aspire to ascend toward superstardom. One of the groups is poor and living in the ghetto, and they are the victims of abusive relationships and broken families. Another group is a typical suburban garage band supported by friends and a family who loves them and cares about their dreams. The third group is filthy rich - and while it would seem the rich guys could simply buy their way to the top, the reality is that the one thing they want more than anything in life can not be bought. Now, while all of these groups of musicians come from vastly diverse backgrounds and have completely different motivations for wanting to become famous, underneath it all, they are all the same.... they just don't know it yet. All of them are going to cross the same bridge, and on the other side, all of them will face choices and all of them will have the opportunity to turn their new world into something beautiful . . . or to let it turn into crap. The choice is theirs, and theirs alone. We are going to find in our story that some people - no matter how talented they may be - simply do not deserve to be famous. For you can fight to make it to the top, and you can struggle to get away from where you've come from . . . but when you get to the end of your journey and you find yourself looking into the mirror expecting to see a superstar facing back at you, you're going to see the truth. You're going to see, more clearly than ever before, all the places where you've been and all the people you've tried so hard to get away from . . . and you're going to realize that nothing has changed. Nothing but you! You are somebody else now. And for the first time in your life - if you are the true superstar - you will be able to see beauty in everything around you. You'll see it in the toughest and least likely of places. And you will fly. Putting her life and fate in her hands, Emily Schooley embarks on a 30 day journey into dice living.

We'll talk with the man at his Manhattan restaurant, Walt Frazier's Wine & Dine, and explore the evolution of his style. Walt 'Clyde' Frazier, perhaps the greatest player in the history of the New York Knickerbockers, has emerged in the 21st century as a Big Apple style icon. In the '70s he was Clyde, a big hatted, mutton chop side burned, cool as ice point guard. Today, in his role as Knicks' broadcaster, Frazier's wardrobe (featuring vibrant colors and shocking patterns) and rhyming couplets that Jay-Z envies. We'll talk with the man at his Manhattan restaurant, Walt Frazier's Wine & Dine, and explore the revolution of his style. It's 1959 and the Cold War rages on. Tensions between the United States and the USSR are at an all-time high. The threat of nuclear war hangs in the balance. But in the midst of this intense psychological warfare, the unlikeliest of heroes step forward, not in a war zone, not at the negotiating table, but on a basketball court. This is the extraordinary tale of the Harlem Globetrotters and their historic trip into the heart of the Soviet Union. Everyday Pete Rose wakes up, and goes to work. He's surrounded by bats, balls, gloves and fans, and approaches each day with the same gusto which defined him on the field. But instead of a dugout, he's seated in a folding chair in a memorabilia store in Las Vegas. Nicknamed "Charlie Hustle," for his efforts on the field, Rose, now 71, agreed to a lifetime ban from baseball in 1989 after an investigation concluded he bet on games when he was the manager for the Cincinnati Reds. The ban has left him ineligible for induction into the Hall of Fame. He leads baseball with 4,256 career hits. The T206 Honus Wagner baseball card is over 100 years old, worth more than 2 million dollars, and has a life story that is a marriage of myth and reality.

For a generation of young sports fans who found their inspiration on the shelves of the local public library or at school book fairs, Alfred Slote is a name revered and cherished. With novels such as "Hang Tough, Paul Mather", "Stranger on the Ball Club", and "Tony and Me" his unique ability to evoke real empathy for his characters influenced countless adolescent readers. While all of these books are "baseball books" on the surface, Slote real interest as a storyteller was not the game but the people, and he elevated the genre of the children's sports book by creating human dramas where the real action was off the field.

In the early hours of Saturday July 27, 1996, a terrorist's bomb exploded into a crowd at the Atlanta Summer Olympics, killing two and injuring 111. The toll would have been far higher if not for security guard Richard Jewell, who discovered the bag holding the bomb and helped clear the area. Yet within hours of his heroism, Jewell was being called a murderer, hounded for months by the government and the largest media gathering in history. The true bomber was later convicted, but when Jewell died in 2007 he was still widely remembered as a victim at best, a killer at worst. Judging Jewell revisits the scene of the crime where Richard Jewell lost the one thing valued most - his honor. In the summer of 2001, a controversy unlike any other led to the disqualification of the Bronx baseball team from the Little League World Series. At the center of the bizarre story was a quiet, unassuming 14-year-old kid named Danny Almonte. Nicknamed "The Little Unit," the hard-throwing left-hander was exposed by Sports Illustrated as being too old to have competed in the tournament. The story instantly caught national and even international attention, as Danny was pushed into the spotlight and accused of cheating in the most sacred of all amateur sports. Twelve years later, the reclusive Almonte finally tells the truth about one of the strangest chapters in youth sports history: a hoax that would forever change the way people view amateur athletics in America. In the 1970's the rust-belt city of Milwaukee, WI used public funds to commission an eccentric, openly gay artist from the Bowery to paint the Bucks basketball floor. In 1988, the Bucks move across the street to the newly constructed Bradley Center - leaving the MECCA Arena floor in storage, all but forgotten by the general public. Fast-forward 25 years - Bucks fan, Andy Gorzalski, discovers the floor for sale for scrap, listed online as a "gym floor." Against better judgment, Andy puts his family's credit card down for $20k to protect this iconic symbol of Milwaukee and basketball history. Over the next year, Andy and another fan, Ben Kohler, team up with Robert Indiana to re-construct and re-exhibit the floor - serving as the inspiration for the Milwaukee Bucks to redesign a new home court floor for their '13-14 NBA season based on the original design. Director Andrew Jenks will sit former NBA center Shawn Bradley down for a candid interview which will act as the narrative spine for a short film about expectations, misconceptions, and a promise, which in hindsight may have not been entirely unfulfilled. During the summer of 2012, a secret meeting took place. But this was no ordinary gathering; instead, a monumental choice was to be made. Reuniting over four decades after the USA men's Olympic basketball team controversially lost the gold to the Russians and declined the silver medal, the 12 team members reunited in Lexington, Ky. to make a decision. And like the jury in "12 Angry Men," the verdict needed to be unanimous -- accept, or forever refuse the medals for a game many of them believe they never lost. 92 tournament wins, seven major championships, a Congressional Gold Medal, and a Presidential Medal of Freedom. These are just a few of the accomplishments that have solidified the legend of Arnold Palmer. However, for an entire generation the "Arnold Palmer" name might be more synonymous with the lemonade-and-iced tea beverage that has become a piece of Americana. Will Arnett, Peter Jacobsen, Fuzzy Zoeller, Jim Thorpe, Fred Funk, Brad Faxon are fans of both the man and drink, and lend their insight to director Bryan Gordon's exploration of the history, mystery, and industry surrounding "The Arnold Palmer." In the winter of 2003 two cities went after the same man. On one side, New York. On the other, Boston. In the middle, the hired gun: Alex Rodriguez. In a 36-hour period, the best player in the league went from the messiah of the Red Sox to the savior of the Yankees. This is the story of all the good, the bad and the eventual contract signed by Alex Rodriguez and the New York Yankees. From 1979 to 1986, Barry Bremen, a Detroit-area novelty goods salesman, became known in the sports world as The Great Imposter. Playfully seeking the spotlight, Bremen posed as a player in the Major Leagues and NBA, PGA golfer, NFL and NHL referee, and even Dallas Cowboys cheerleader. In doing so Bremen not only became known as sports ultimate fan but also managed to live out the dreams of legions of failed high school all-stars and armchair quarterbacks across the nation. This short will explore the origins and nuances of the high five, bringing to life the unique legacy of the gesture and the story of one of its unsung originators. The filmmakers will tell the story of Glenn Burke and his origins as a baseball prodigy, his time in the majors and spontaneous "invention" of the gesture. Using this moment, the story then pivots to chronicle the simultaneous spread of the high five as both celebratory and political gesture alongside the professional and personal decline of Glenn Burke. John Tuggle, the 1983 NFL draft's Mr. Irrelevant, was anything but irrelevant to legendary coach Bill Parcells. The normally tough and gruff coach will guide us on an emotional journey as he recounts his own rookie season as the head coach of the New York Giants and the year he came to know this very special athlete who made his team against all odds. But only one year later, a rare and unbeatable form of cancer would change both John's and Coach Parcells' destinies leaving behind a lasting impact on teammates and the life of the coach who understands just how fragile life can be. The season's schedule for major league baseball affects the lives and moods of millions of Americans. Each year executives and managers ridicule the logic, sportswriters and broadcasters question the sanity, and athletes and fans cast blame. Yet not many people know how it is that the MLB schedule is figured out, and even fewer have any idea what is involved. The masterminds for 25 years behind this massive logistical undertaking were Henry and Holly Stephenson. A husband and wife duo working out of an upstairs bedroom in their Staten Island home with a computer, a pencil and a great deal of cooperation. How did this mom-and-pop team ever end up with the daunting and thankless job of MLB scheduling? This is the story of how the Stephensons landed their first MLB contract and became "The Schedule Makers." An intimate, funny and compelling take on the unique relationship and shared legacy of Tommy John, the chatty Indiana lefty who won nearly 300 Major League games, and Dr. Frank Jobe, the unassuming L.A. Orthopedist who conceived and performed a revolutionary elbow operation on John in 1974. In 1977, Marquette coach Al McGuire let his star player, Bo Ellis, design the team's uniforms. The most iconic, the untucked jersey, signified the power of uniforms and the benefits of a creative atmosphere, which allowed a Championship team to flourish. In 1954, before his senior year of high school, Wilt Chamberlain took a summer job that would change his life, working as a bellhop at Kutsher's Country Club, a Jewish resort in the Catskill Mountains. An unexplored and pivotal chapter in the life of one of basketball's greatest players, and a fascinating glimpse of a time when a very different era of basketball met the Borscht Belt in its heyday. ESPN Films' 30 for 30 is an unprecedented documentary series featuring today's finest storytellers from inside and outside of the sports world. What started as a celebration of ESPN's 30th anniversary has come to life as an eclectic and fascinating collection of passionate films about sports and culture. Individually, each of the films in this series is meant to tell an intimate, compelling story that stands on its own and brings to life the filmmaker's vision. Collectively, however, these creatively different films weave together a diverse tapestry of what sports has meant to culture. Ultimately, 30 For 30 strives to sit the viewer down and tell a story, employing many sources but giving a distinctive point of view, marshaling words and images to serve that particular perspective. In a sports universe of competing voices, these films offer a single, compelling one. In the history of the Olympics, there's never been a controversy quite like what ensued over the 100 meter race at Seoul in 1988. The match brought together Carl Lewis (USA) and Ben Johnson (Canada) who had been fierce competitors. Lewis was known as a savvy careerist who became an American hero at the previous Los Angeles Olympics. Johnson was his chief rival, considered an underdog due to his recovery from a pulled hamstring. In less than 10 seconds, Johnson edged out in front of Lewis to win the Seoul race. But that wasn't the end. Three days later, in a reversal of fortune, the Olympic committee announced that Johnson had failed a drug test, losing his medal to Lewis in disgrace. A mystery still shrouds the race. Was Johnson exceptional in his drug usage or merely the fall guy for a widespread practice? Six of the eight finalists in the 1988 race have since been implicated for drugs -- although some still deny any wrongdoing. Filmmaker Daniel Gordon, digs into the controversy, conducting extensive interviews with Lewis and Johnson as well as their competitors, coaches and Olympic insiders. He uncovers layers of intrigue, deception and favoritism that change our perception of the way this story has previously been told. The Seoul race wound up being the world's wake-up call to drugs in sports. Now the problem runs rampant throughout professional and amateur athletics. As drug-testing gets more sophisticated, so do means of evading it. This powerful story forces us to question what we expect from our athletes as they pursue records in the name of national pride. This story from the past is vital to understanding the future of sports. Few teams in professional sports history elicit such a wide range of emotions as the Detroit Pistons of the late 1980s and early '90s. For some, the team was heroic - made up of gritty, hard-nosed players who didn't back down from anyone. And for others, it was exactly that trait - the willingness to do seemingly anything to win - that made them the "Bad Boys," the team fans loved to hate. No drama is complete without compelling characters, and the Bad Boys Pistons had a full cast. Viewers will see the many factors that drove one of the best - and most complex - players in NBA history: Isiah Thomas, a lethal combination of sweetness on the outside and toughness within. In addition, the team was characterized by the toughness of Bill Laimbeer and Rick Mahorn; the quiet intensity of Joe Dumars; the savvy and fearlessness of a young Dennis Rodman; the comic relief provided by John Salley; and the mixture of grit, professionalism and style possessed by coach Chuck Daly. Sandwiched between the Lakers' and Celtics' dominance of the 1980s and the Bulls' run in the 1990s, the Pistons' two titles in 1989 and '90 are often viewed as a transitional period in NBA history, rather than a dynamic championship era in its own right. But for anyone who experienced the Bad Boys in action, they more than carved out their own identity, both in the league and in American popular culture. Now, viewers will finally get the untold story behind one of the most unique championship teams in NBA history. In 1984, Chicago was in the heady grip of a Black Renaissance. Harold Washington was mayor, Michael Jordan had just signed with the Bulls, Oprah Winfrey was hosting a local morning show, and on the South Side a young man named Ben Wilson was the most talked-about basketball prospect in a city that was known for its great hoops talent. Handsome, gentle and magnetic, Ben Wilson's magical ability on the court was matched by his popularity in his school and neighborhood. In his junior year, he led Simeon High School to its first state championship. And that summer, he was named America's number-one high school basketball player by the nation's leading talent scouts. Then, on the eve of his senior season, the career of this exceptional youngster was abruptly and tragically cut short. Ben's grim fate sent ripples of horror through the city and the country. BENJI tells the story of a legend who might've been. Bernard King arrived to Knoxville, he was only the third African American ever to play for the Vols' varsity team. By the time he left he was a legend. In his freshman year he dazzled fans in Knoxville, and with talented teammate Ernie Grunfeld, gained national acclaim as part of what was known as "The Ernie and Bernie Show". King was a three time SEC player of the year, a consensus All-American in 1977 and drafted by the New Jersey Nets in the first round. We will learn about King's strict upbringing in Brooklyn, New York, the success he enjoyed and the challenges he faced at the University of Tennessee, and the obstacles he overcame in the NBA as he looked to live up to the promise of his college career. "It may sound egotistical to say, but I never surprised myself-or almost never-because I prepared to be successful. When it all came together, I was the best in the game." Bernard King In 1996, the once-dominant New York Islanders were in serious trouble. Lousy performance and poor management were driving away the hockey franchise's loyal fan base. The team hit bottom. Then along came a Dallas businessman named John Spano, who swooped in and agreed to buy the team for 165 million dollars. Things began to look up for the Islanders - way up. But it was all smoke and mirrors. Big Shot goes inside an extraordinary scandal that engulfed the Islanders. Featuring the only interview Spano has ever given about the Islanders deal, this film is an unforgettable tale of a dream that became a lie - and how a scam of such epic proportions initially went undetected. According to a 2009 Sports Illustrated article, 60 percent of former NBA players are broke within five years of retirement. By the time they have been retired for two years, 78% of former NFL players have gone bankrupt or are under financial stress. Sucked into bad investments, stalked by freeloaders, saddled with medical problems, and naturally prone to showing off, many pro athletes get shocked by harsh economic realities after years of living the high life. Drawing surprisingly vulnerable confessions from retired stars like Keith McCants, Bernie Kosar and Andre Rison, as well as Marvin Miller, the former executive director of the MLB Players Association, this fascinating documentary digs into the psychology of men whose competitive nature can carry them to victory on the field and ruin off it. Director Billy Corben (The U, Cocaine Cowboys, Limelight) paints a complex picture of the many forces that drain athletes' bank accounts, placing some of the blame on the culture at large while still holding these giants accountable for their own hubris. A story of the dark side of success, "Broke," is an allegory for the financial woes haunting economies and individuals all over the world. "The Natural is supposed to be a blue-eyed boy who teethed on a 36-ounce Louisville Slugger. He should run like the wind and throw boysenberries through brick. He should come from California." Steve Wulf, Sports Illustrated, 1981. So how was it that a pudgy 19-year-old Mexican left-handed pitcher from a remote village in the Sonoran desert, unable to speak a word of English, could sell out stadiums across America and become a rock star overnight? In Fernando Nation, Mexican-born and Los Angeles-raised director Cruz Angeles traces the history of a community that was torn apart when Dodger Stadium was built in Chavez Ravine and then revitalized by one of the most captivating pitching phenoms baseball has ever seen. Nicknamed "El Toro" by his fans, Fernando Valenzuela ignited a fire that spread from LA to New York -- and beyond. He vaulted himself onto the prime-time stage and proved with his signature look to the heavens and killer screwball that the American dream was not reserved for those born on U.S. soil. In this layered look at the myth and the man, Cruz Angeles recalls the euphoria around Fernando's arrival and probes a phenomenon that transcended baseball for many Mexican-Americans. Fernando Valenzuela himself opens up to share his perspective on this very special time. Even 20 years later, "Fernandomania" lives. When the night of October 16, 2004 came to a merciful end, the Curse of the Bambino was alive and well. The vaunted Yankee lineup, led by A-Rod, Jeter, and Sheffield, had just extended their ALCS lead to three games to none, pounding out 19 runs against their hated rivals. The next night, in Game 4, the Yankees took a 4-3 lead into the bottom of the ninth inning, then turned the game over to Mariano Rivera, the best relief pitcher in post-season history, to secure yet another trip to the World Series. But after a walk and a hard-fought stolen base, the cold October winds of change began to blow. Over four consecutive days and nights, this unlikely group of Red Sox miraculously won four straight games to overcome the inevitability of their destiny. Using extensive archive coverage from that week, Major League Baseball Productions will produce a film in "real-time" that takes an in-depth look at the 96 hours that brought salvation to Red Sox Nation and made baseball history in the process. When the American Basketball Association disbanded in 1976, four ABA franchises joined the NBA - the Nets, Nuggets, Pacers and Spurs. But one of the odd teams out found a different way to secure its future. Free Spirits tells the colorful story of the Spirits of St. Louis - an entertaining and at times controversial team featuring stars like Marvin "Bad News" Barnes and James "Fly" Williams with an upstart sportscaster named Bob Costas calling the play-by-play. The spirits managed to pull off a stunning playoff upset of the defending champions in their first season, and then, on their way to franchise extinction, co-owners Daniel and Ozzie Silna managed to negotiate a contract that has allowed the team to continue to exist in the most unusual fashion. In the fall of 1962, a dramatic series of events made Civil Rights history and changed a way of life. On the eve of James Meredith becoming the first African-American to attend class at the University of Mississippi, the campus erupted into a night of rioting between those opposed to the integration of the school and those trying to enforce it. Before the rioting ended, the National Guard and Federal troops were called in to put an end to the violence and enforce Meredith's rights as an American citizen. Two people died and hundreds more were injured during the riots. Against this backdrop, the University of Mississippi football team was in the early stages of what would prove to be an unprecedented season in school history. Directed by Peabody Award-winning filmmaker Fritz Mitchell, "Ghosts of Ole Miss" explores the intersection of that football team with the Civil Rights history being made on campus. Told through the perspective of writer and Mississippi native Wright Thompson, the film explores the tumultuous events that not only continue to shape the state half a century later, but also led to his discovery of a personal family connection to the story. In 1980, Terry Fox continued his fight against bone cancer with the pursuit of a singular, motivating vision: to run across Canada. Three years after having his right leg amputated six inches above the knee after being diagnosed with osteosarcoma, Fox set out to cover more than a marathon's distance each day until he reached the shores of Victoria, British Columbia. Anonymous at the start of his journey, Fox steadily captured the heart of a nation with his Marathon of Hope. However the 21-year old BC native's goal was not fame, but to spread awareness and raise funds for cancer research. After 143 days and two-thirds of the way across Canada, with the eyes of a country watching, Fox's journey came to an abrupt end when newly discovered tumors took over his body. Two-time NBA MVP, proud Canadian, and first-time filmmaker Steve Nash will share Fox's incredible story of perseverance and hope. In the fall of 1993, in his prime and at the summit of the sports world, Michael Jordan walked away from pro basketball. After leading the Dream Team to an Olympic gold medal in 1992 and taking the Bulls to their third consecutive NBA championship the following year, Jordan was jolted by the murder of his father. Was it the brutal loss of such an anchor in his life that caused the world's most famous athlete to rekindle a childhood ambition by playing baseball? Or some feeling that he had nothing left to prove or conquer in basketball? Or something deeper and perhaps not yet understood? Ron Shelton, a former minor leaguer who brought his experiences to life in the classic movie "Bull Durham," will revisit Jordan's short career in the minor leagues and explore the motivations that drove the world's most competitive athlete to play a new sport in the relative obscurity of Birmingham, Alabama, for a young manager named Terry Francona. Covers events on the day OJ Simpson was pursued and arrested on charges of murdering his ex wife and her boyfriend. No additional footage or voice over was shot and the entire documentary is encapsulated in sound bites from various feeds on the day. On August 9, 1988, the NHL was forever changed with the single stroke of a pen. The Edmonton Oilers, fresh off their fourth Stanley Cup victory in five years, signed a deal that sent Wayne Gretzky, a Canadian national treasure and the greatest hockey player ever to play the game, to the Los Angeles Kings in a multi-player, multi-million dollar deal. As bewildered Oiler fans struggled to make sense of the unthinkable, fans in Los Angeles were rushing to purchase season tickets at a rate so fast it overwhelmed the Kings box office. Overnight, a franchise largely overlooked in its 21-year existence was suddenly playing to sellout crowds and standing ovations, and a league often relegated to "little brother" status exploded from 21 teams to 30 in less than a decade. Acclaimed director Peter Berg presents the captivating story of the trade that knocked the wind out of an entire country, and placed a star-studded city right at the humble feet of a 27-year-old kid, known simply as "The Great One." On August 28, 1982, Cody Webster and a small group of schoolyard friends from Kirkland, Wash., sat anxiously in a dugout waiting to take the field for the championship game of the Little League World Series. Their focus was just about what you'd expect from any 12-year-old: hit the ball, throw strikes, cross your fingers and then maybe -- maybe -- you'll win. Adults in the stands and watching from home saw a much broader field of play. The memories of American hostages and a crippling oil crisis were still fresh; the economic malaise of the late 1970s still lingered; and the new President was recovering from an assassination attempt even while confronting new threats from the Soviet Union. Meanwhile, back on that tiny baseball field in Williamsport, Penn., where America's game was celebrated each summer, no American team had won a true international Little League World Series Championship in more than a decade. When the Kirkland players rushed from their dugout that day, they stepped onto a much bigger field than the one they saw. What they did, how they did it, and what happened to each of the players in the years that followed is a multi-faceted story. Emmy Award-winning filmmaker Al Szymanski examines what became of a group of childhood teammates when the high point in their lives occurred before their lives had really begun. Few athletes in Olympic history have reached such heights and depths as Marion Jones. After starring at the University of North Carolina and winning gold at the 1997 and '99 World Track and Field Championships, her rise to the top culminated at the 2000 Summer Games in Sydney, Australia. There, she captivated the world with her beauty, style and athletic dominance as she sprinted and jumped to three gold medals and two bronze. Eventually, though, her accomplishments and her reputation would be tarnished. For years, Jones denied the increasing speculation that she used performance-enhancing drugs. But in October 2007, she finally admitted what so many had long suspected -- that she had indeed used steroids. Jones was sentenced to six months in prison for lying to federal investigators and soon saw her Olympic achievements disqualified. Now a free woman, Jones is running in a new direction in life and taking time to reflect. We follow the preparations for Ali's final attempt to win back the World Heavyweight title. Even during the lead up to the fight grave concerns were held for Ali's health and the man who stepped into the ring was frail imitation of his former self. There has always been questions raised about Allen Iverson's conviction for a fight he was involved in as a young man. The film maker goes back to his home town to try and understand the events and how they have left a mark on the town he calls home. In the midst of boxing's contemporary golden age -ï¿½ the 1980's -ï¿½ stood two fighters who established a captivating rivalry. Their pair of bouts within a span of just over 5 months in 1980 had all the trappings of instant classics. Sugar Ray Leonard, an American hero, who had become a household name after a Gold Medal-winning performance at the 1976 Summer Olympics that led to numerous corporate sponsorships, versus the Latino champion, Roberto Duran, the toughest -ï¿½ some said meanest -ï¿½ fighter of all time. It was not just the drama and action of these fights that would endure, but those two words uttered in the second of their clashes, which would create a sense of mystery, bewilderment and intrigue to the present day. No Mas unveils for the first time what really happened, going behind the scenes of these two showdowns with the help of boxing experts, family members and the two fighters themselves. Drazen Petrovic and Vlade Divac were two friends who grew up together sharing the common bond of basketball. Together, they lifted the Yugoslavian National team to unimaginable heights. After conquering Europe, they both went to America where they became the first two foreign players to attain NBA stardom. But with the fall of the Soviet Union on Christmas Day 1991, Yugoslavia split up. A war broke out between Petrovic's Croatia and Divac's Serbia. Long buried ethnic tensions surfaced. And these two men, once brothers, were now on opposite sides of a deadly civil war. As Petrovic and Divac continued to face each other on the basketball courts of the NBA, no words passed between the two. Then, on the fateful night of June 7, 1993, Drazen Petrovic was killed in an auto accident. "Once Brothers" will tell the gripping tale of these two men, how circumstances beyond their control tore apart their friendship, and whether Divac has ever come to terms with the death of a friend before they had a chance to reconcile. On the evening of Sept. 7, 1996, Mike Tyson, the WBC heavyweight champion, attempted to take Bruce Seldon's WBA title at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. At this point in his career, Tyson's fights had become somewhat of a cultural phenomenon, where the ever present hype of the professional boxing scene would come face to face with the worlds of big business, Hollywood, and hip hop. Sitting ringside was controversial rapper Tupac Shakur. Shakur and Tyson were friends, a feeling of kinship linked them as each rose to stardom from poverty only to be thrown in prison. Following Tyson's victory, Shakur and "Iron Mike" were to celebrate at an after party, but the rap star never arrived. Shakur was brutally gunned down later that night, and the scene in Las Vegas quickly turned from would-be celebratory revelry to ill fated and inopportune tragedy. Director Reggie Bythewood, with the full cooperation of Mike Tyson, will tell not only the story of that infamous night but of the remarkable friendship between Tyson and Tupac. . From 1981-1984, a small private school in Dallas owned the best record in college football. The Mustangs of Southern Methodist University (SMU) were riding high on the backs of the vaunted "Pony Express" backfield. But as the middle of the decade approached, the program was coming apart at the seams. Wins became the only thing that mattered as the University increasingly ceded power of the football program to the city's oil barons and real estate tycoons and flagrant and frequent NCAA violations became the norm. On February 25, 1987, the school and the sport were rocked, as the NCAA meted out "the death penalty" on a college football program for the first and only time in its history. SMU would be without football for two years, and the fan base would be without an identity for 20 more until the Mustangs' win in the 2009 Hawaii Bowl. This is the story of Dallas in the 1980's and the greed, power, and corruption that spilled from the oil fields onto the football field and all the way to the Governor's Mansion. Director Thaddeus D. Matula, a product of the SMU film school, chronicles the rise, fall, and rebirth of this once mighty team. He has won four Olympic gold medals, graced the cover of Time magazine and been honored as Sportsman of the Year by Sports Illustrated. Yet if you say the name Johann Olav Koss in this country, you'll usually be met with a casual shrug. Instead of cashing in on his Olympic haul, Koss embarked on a remarkable journey that has established him as one of the world's greatest ambassadors of sports. As the founder, President and CEO of Right To Play, Koss and his army of volunteers, teachers, coaches and diplomats have used the power of athletics to elevate the lives of the world's neediest children. As it turns out, Frank Marshall, one of Hollywood's most acclaimed producers and a member of the U.S. Olympic Hall of Fame, witnessed Koss's triumphs on the ice in the 1994 Lillehammer Olympic Games. Now Marshall will reveal the epiphany that led Koss to start Right To Play, and attempt to uncover the motivation that drives him to crisscross the globe, establishing new programs and literally saving lives in the process. Some day, Johann may win a Nobel Peace Prize. But for now, this film will serve as an introduction to an uncommon and selfless man who embodies the power and glory of sport. This documentary follows the life of Ricky Williams, a star for the Miami Dolphins who walked away from the sport at the height of his over drug allegations. Ricky tells a different story about betrayal an turning his back on what many value - fame fortune and celeb status. Charts the origins of fantasy sports games from a small lunchtime group known as the rotisserie league to the multi-million dollar industry it is today. The show also explores how none of the founders made money or even play the game anymore. Before Lance Armstrong, there was Greg LeMond, who is now the first and only American to win the Tour de France. In this engrossing documentary, LeMond looks back at the pivotal 1986 Tour, and his increasingly vicious rivalry with friend, teammate, and mentor Bernard Hinault. The reigning Tour champion and brutal competitor known as "The Badger," Hinault 'promised' to help LeMond to his first victory, in return for LeMond supporting him in the previous year. But in a sport that purports to reward teamwork, it's really every man for himself. In 1983 the upstart United States Football League (USFL) had the audacity to challenge the almighty NFL. The new league did the unthinkable by playing in the spring and plucked three straight Heisman Trophy winners away from the NFL. The 12-team USFL played before crowds that averaged 25,000, and started off with respectable TV ratings. But with success came expansion and new owners. This included a certain high profile and impatient real estate baron whose vision was at odds with the league's founders. Soon, the USFL was reduced to waging a desperate anti-trust lawsuit against the NFL. This yielded an ironic verdict that effectively forced the league out of business. Now, almost a quarter of a century later, Academy Award-nominated and Peabody Award-winning director Mike Tollin, himself once a chronicler of the league, will showcase the remarkable influence of those three years on football history and attempt to answer the question, "Who Killed the USFL?" For rapper-turned-filmmaker Ice Cube the emergence of gangster rap will be forever linked to the Oakland Raiders' move to Los Angeles in 1982. He turns the camera on himself to tell how his genre-defining group NWA forged an unlikely relationship with the Raiders, a team whose swagger and style captivated LA during their troubled 13-season stay. In 1983, the NC State Wolfpack, coached by Jim Valvano, stayed alive in the post-season through a series of nine overtime and one point games, beating the likes of Michael Jordan and Sam Perkins. The unlikely squad made it to the national championship game against #1 Houston, aka Phi Salma Jama, a team featuring future NBA Top 50 all-time players Akeem Olajuwon and Clyde Drexler. NC State was one of the biggest underdogs ever in the final game, one that went down as possibly the best college basketball game in history-ending with one of the most well-known plays of all time. This episode tells the story of the overnight relocation of the Baltimore Colts to the city of Indianapolis. We explore the reactions of the fans, the various actions and interviews with the teams owner and finally how the band kept the spirit of a professional football team alive until the arrival of the Baltimore Ravens in 1996. In 1981, college athletic recruiting changed forever as a dozen big-time football programs sat waiting for the decision by a physically powerful and lightning-quick high school running back named Marcus Dupree. On his way to eclipsing Herschel Walker's record for the most touchdowns in high school history, Dupree attracted recruiters from schools in every major conference to his hometown of Philadelphia, Miss. More than a decade removed from being a flashpoint in the civil-rights struggle, Philadelphia was once again thrust back into the national spotlight. Dupree took the attention in stride, and committed to Oklahoma. What followed, though, was a forgettable college career littered with conflict, injury and oversized expectations. Eight-time Emmy Award winner Jonathan Hock examined why this star burned out so young and how he ultimately used football to redeem himself. In 1985, at the tender age of 13, Mat Hoffman entered into the BMX circuit as an amateur, and by 16 he had risen to the professional level. Throughout his storied career, Hoffman has ignored conventional limitations, instead, focusing his efforts on the purity of the sport and the pursuit of "what's next." His motivations stem purely from his own ambitions, and even without endorsements, cameras, fame and fans, Hoffman would still be working to push the boundaries of gravity. Academy Award nominee Spike Jonze and extreme sport fanatic Johnny Knoxville, along with director Jeff Tremaine, will showcase the inner workings and exploits of the man who gave birth to "Big Air." In the winter of 2003 two cities went after the same man. On one side, New York. On the other, Boston. In the middle, the hired gun: Alex Rodriguez. In a 36-hour period, the best player in the league went from the messiah of the Red Sox to the savior of the Yankees. This is the story of all the good, the bad and the eventual contract signed by Alex Rodriguez and the New York Yankees. Love him or hate him, there is no denying that George Steinbrenner has been one of the most colorful and successful owners in contemporary sports. Heading up a group that bought the New York Yankees in 1973 for $10 million, "King George" emphatically branded the world's most celebrated sports franchise as his own. The Boss has boasted 10 pennants, 6 World Series trophies and a corporate net worth more than $1 billion. But for all the glory and riches, the Steinbrenner legacy is also mixed with wasteful and embarrassing spending and countless episodes of tabloid-style soap. Now with George's health seriously failing, the Steinbrenner heirs are finally beginning to emerge from their father's larger-than-life shadow as they collectively move his franchise into a new home and a new era. This film follows the career of Jimmy Synder, a professional gambler. He helped legitimize betting in NFL games by finding ways to give points spreads during pre-game shows. His demise was both dramatic and swift when he finally stepped over the mark. The world couldn't keep its eyes off two athletes at the 1994 Winter Games in Lillehammer - Nancy Kerrigan, the elegant brunette and Tonya Harding, the feisty blonde engulfed in scandal. Just weeks before the Olympics on January 6, 1994 at the U.S. Figure Skating Championships, Kerrigan was stunningly clubbed on the right knee by an unknown assailant and left wailing, "Why, why, why?" As the bizarre "why" mystery unraveled, it was revealed that Harding's ex-husband, Jeff Gillooly, had plotted the attack with his misfit friends to literally eliminate Kerrigan from the competition. Now two decades later, The Price of Gold takes a fresh look at the worldwide spectacle that elevated the popularity of professional figure skating and has Harding still facing questions over what she knew when she knew it. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, many believe, Pablo Escobar's Medellï¿½n Cartel and the Cali Cartels were largely responsible for financing and building the Colombian National soccer team into one of the world's best. But in an early match against the United States in the 1994 FIFA World Cup, a Colombian defense man named Andres Escobar-no relation to Pablo-committed an own goal that led to the team's elimination. Less than ten days later, Escobar was gunned down outside a bar in a suburb of Medellin. He was shot 12 times, and the murderer shouted "goal" each time the trigger was pulled. Was Escobar's murder an isolated incident, or were gambling organizations controlled by the cartels responsible? Award-winning director Jeff Zimbalist will examine the mysterious events leading up to and surrounding Andres Escobar's death. Throughout the 1980s, Miami, Florida, was at the center of a racial and cultural shift taking place throughout the country. Overwhelmed by riots and tensions, Miami was a city in flux, and the University of Miami football team served as a microcosm for this evolution. The image of the predominantly white university was forever changed when coach Howard Schnellenberger scoured some of the toughest ghettos in Florida to recruit mostly black players for his team. With a newly branded swagger, inspired and fueled by the quickly growing local Miami hip hop culture, these Hurricanes took on larger-than-life personalities and won four national titles between 1983 and 1991. On December 10, 2010, Sotheby's auctioned off what could be considered the most important historical document in sports history -- James Naismith's original rules of basketball. "There's No Place Like Home" is the story of one man's fanatical quest to win this seminal American artifact at auction and bring the rules "home" to Lawrence, Kansas, where Naismith coached and taught for over 40 years. When Jimmy Connors arrived in New York for the 1991 U.S. Open, the one-time tennis superstar was 8 years removed from his last Grand Slam singles title, ranked 174th in the world and approaching his 39th birthday. Not exactly a recipe for success. But on the verge of a quick first-round exit, Connors suddenly and unexpectedly re-captured the magic, embarking on a stirring and extraordinary run than included an epic contest with Aaron Krickstein on his way to the semifinals. This is What They Want not only illuminates this highly improbably march past a series of talented and youthful adversaries, it also explores how Connors became a polarizing and provocative personality who helped make tennis a high-octane spectator sport. Natural. Rock star. Outsider. In the 1980s, race car driver Tim Richmond lived his life the way he raced cars - wide open. Born into a wealthy family, Richmond was the antithesis of the Southern, blue-collar, dirt-track racers who dominated NASCAR. He also was a flamboyant showman who basked in the attention of the media and fans - especially the attention of female admirers. Nevertheless, it was Richmond's on-track performances that ended up drawing comparisons to racing legends. And in 1986, when he won seven NASCAR races and finished third in the Winston Cup series points race, some believed he was on the verge of stardom. But soon his freewheeling lifestyle caught up to him. He unexpectedly withdrew from the NASCAR racing circuit, reportedly suffering from double pneumonia. In reality, the diagnosis was much more dire: He had AIDS. Richmond returned to the track in 1987, but he was gone from the sport by the next year as his health deteriorated. He spent his final days as a recluse, dying on Aug.13, 1989, at the age of 34. Emmy Award-winning filmmaker Rory Karpf will examine the life and tragic death of one of NASCAR's shooting stars. The first time Chris Evert and Martina Navratilova stepped onto a tennis court together, the world scarcely noticed. Only a few hundred spectators saw the pert 18-year-old beat the scrappy 16-year-old Czech in 1973. "I remember that she was fat," Evert recalled. "She was very emotional on the court, whining if she didn't feel she was playing well. But I remember thinking, if she loses weight, we're all in trouble." Said Navratilova, "My goal was for her to remember my name." Eighty matches later -- amid the extraordinary growth of women's tennis -- Evert not only remembered, but became a tried and true friend and confidante, remarkable considering the two appeared to be polar opposites in upbringing, life styles and personal relationships. Through a series of personal conversations, filmmakers Nancy Stern Winters and Lisa Lax, along with producer Hannah Storm, tell the story of one of the greatest one-on-one sports rivalries and capture these two extraordinary athletes' views on tennis and an ever-changing world. A close look at Bo Jackson, a sports hero of mythical proportions, and how the "Bo Knows" Nike campaign shaped how the world perceived him. Without winning a Super Bowl or World Series, or even having what some consider a "great" career in either sport, Bo will be forever be known as one of the greatest and most famous athletes of all time. This film will look at the marketing of athletes, impossible expectations and the legend of Bo Jackson. Youngstown Boys is a feature documentary exploring class and power dynamics in college sports through the parallel, interconnected journeys of Maurice Clarett and Jim Tressel. These two stars emerged from opposite sides of the tracks in Youngstown, Ohio. They joined together for a magic season at Ohio State University in 2002 and a national championship. Shortly thereafter, Clarett was banished from college football and began a downward spiral that ended with a prison term. Tressel continued at Ohio State for another eight years before his career there also ended in scandal. Now, both Youngstown Boys are attempting to reinvent themselves and resurrect their lives. More and more Swedes travel to Thailand each year. This year close to 600,000 Swedes will have visited Thailand (that's 7% of the entire Swedish population!). More than half of all Swedes have visited Thailand at least once. Almost everyone knows someone who has been there. They are the new emigrants. Just like the last wave of emigrants to America, some are fleeing and some are searching for a dream. But they have one thing in common; they are unhappy and seeking happiness. A better life. On the other side of the world.

Thirty Seconds is a Docu Soap that registers the daily work at a fire station, using a language that mixes documentary and reality. A production crew complete with a camera and journal teams, lives at a fire house ready to accompany, aboard the fire truck, firefighters to their next call. Napoleon and Cordelia Bopsie have just turned 30, and to the very few twitter followers they have, they sent out a not so happy birthday tweet which read; 30 sux! They recently were shown on an episode of "E!'s True Hollywood Story" which reminded the world of the twins fall from fame after their hit Disney show "The Bopsie's" was canceled at the age of 17. Now that E! has caused a media war, Cordelia and Napoleon's agent Olive insists on a comeback. There's just one problem, neither will do anything unless they remain inside their house. The solution to this was supposed to be easy, a reality show, but the two twins make it nearly impossible for head of the show Panky. In the lower east side of New York City the entire graduating high school class of forty-five seniors collaborated to produce a documentary addressing fatherlessness. Featured in this documentary are four stories that illustrate the impact the presence or absence a father has on family members and community. One teen female who was never reared by her father focuses on a strong bond with her mother, while another revels in a solid relationship with her father. A fully committed teen father stands the test of time at the side of his son and daughter, while a teen male whose father left him when he was three years old lauds the relationship with his mother and an uncle who played a strong male role model in his life. An introspective look by young people on what defines a responsible father necessary to make a positive difference in his child's life.

Some ten days earlier Walter a gambling addict had his arm broken by Billy Lamb,a local money-lender and small time crook,to whom Walter is in debt. With her husband off work Gracie takes in a lodger,a young Irishman who calls himself Sid,who is on the run, along with his friend Pat. In 2011 Frank still lives in the house with his daughter Ellie,her husband Nick,a reformed alcoholic and his teen-aged daughter Poppy. Frank is now an invalid and engages a carer,Joy,who faces deportation back to Nigeria as her visa has expired. Poppy finds various items from 1931,including coins,under the floor boards of her room. Walter's injury costs him his job though he keeps it from Gracie and reluctantly joins Lamb's gang as they rob silver from a church,which Walter hides at his house. Elizabeth notices that Violet,Gracie and Walter's 15-year old daughter, is pregnant and suggests an abortion whilst Gracie finds Sid increasingly attractive. Joy's boyfriend David,a married doctor,is unhappy that she is still in Manchester as he has tired of her. In the same day he sees Ellie,who has problems conceiving and recommends costly IVF treatment,and Poppy,for whom he prescribes the pill,unbeknown to Ellie and Nick. Nick's business is failing and he attends a meeting to save it,rather than going to the doctor with Ellie,causing her to doubt if he wants a baby. Lamb pressurises Walter into keeping look-out for a burglary that goes wrong. Violet's younger sister Nora has a fall and she is rescued by Sid. Gracie is angry with Walter for being out when he should have been minding his daughter. She also stops Elizabeth from taking Violet to an abortionist,claiming that the girl could die on the abortionist's table. On Frank's birthday Poppy gives him the photo album from the 1930s she found in her room.David is surprised to see Joy working for Frank but Nick is annoyed with the doctor for putting Poppy on the pill. Feeling alienated from his family Nick makes a play for Lynne,his AA sponsor,who rejects him and sends him home to Ellie. Ellie,desperate for a baby,asks Frank to put the house in her name to finance the IVF. Elizabeth proposes that Violet goes to a friend in Blackpool to have her baby away from local gossips. Sid confesses to Gracie that his real name is Francis,or Frank for short. He has been caught up in sectarian killings in Ireland and,with Pat,hopes to escape an assassin following them and sail to New York.He asks her to take the girls and go with him but she refuses. Then he hears that Pat has been murdered. Billy Lamb is also killed - by Walter,with a candlestick stolen from the church after Lamb has threatened Walter's family. He hides the body in the coal-hole for the time being. Frank overhears David tell Joy he will not leave his wife for her and consoles her. Nick warns Mikey,Poppy's boyfriend,to stay away from her but this only results in the youngsters running off together. Gracie is prepared to go to America with Francis but is moved that Walter killed Lamb because he was threatening her and the girls and stays behind,giving her ticket to Violet - which is why Frank cannot identify Violet or Francis from the photo album. Walter then walls up Lamb's body in the attic. Gracie is pregnant and will name her child Frank after his father. Poppy returns with Mikey and walks into an onslaught from Nick but Ellie defuses the situation and the family are able to talk sensibly and reach a compromise. Frank decides that,with his declining health,he will move into a rest home,giving Ellie the house and paying for Joy to return to Africa on her own terms. The family now united they set about enlarging the attic as a bedroom for Poppy. As they knock the wall down they make a shocking discovery. Three beautiful women occupy the penthouse apartment at 33 Brompton Place in the ritzy Near North Side of Chicago.

Watch news from across the nation and around the world with a range of headlines for the LGBT community. Learning that Grey had advised Germany of French neutrality without the knowledge of France George V informs Wilhelm that there has been a 'misunderstanding', a statement that fuels the German belief in British duplicity. Hatred of socialism also makes war seem attractive and, to Jens' horror, the parliament vote for war credits. In England at another contentious cabinet meeting Grey and Asquith point out Britain's duty to upholding the Entente Cordiale supporting France in the likelihood of invasion, after which French ambassador Cambon requests a British military presence to intimidate Germany. With the news that the Germans have violated the neutrality of Belgium by using it as a corridor to attach France the British government, following an impassioned speech by Lloyd George, sees itself as having no option but to declare war on Germany. In a coda Alec and Jens, both in battle-dress, recount the terrible cost of the conflict. June 28, 1914:- Young Foreign Office clerk Alec recounts his delivering a telegram to his German-born boss, assistant under secretary Eyre Crowe, informing that the Austrian archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife have been murdered in Sarajevo by Gavrilo Princip, a member of the Black Hand gang who resent Austrian influence in Serbia. In Berlin another young civil servant Jens takes up the story, reflecting on the German Kaiser Wilhelm's friendship with the dead man. Wilhelm hates the Serbians and sees the slaying as an act of aggression by the nation. He sends ambassador Lichnowsky to London to sound out Foreign Secretary Sir Edward Grey as to what would happen if Britain and Russia championed their ally Serba but Grey is more concerned with problems over Ireland and, of his cabinet, only Winston Churchill foresees any great danger looming. Grey wants to instigate peace talks among the nations involved but in Berlin Wilhelm and his chief of staff Von Moltke are bent on revenge. Europe is now only thirteen days away from war. The Foreign Office is perturbed to learn that Austria wants war in the Balkans with an impossible ultimatum backed by Germany. Grey summons the Austrian ambassador to no avail and his peace proposal to the reasonable Lichnowsky is not immediately acceptable to the unstable Kaiser, particularly when he learns that the Russian army is mobilizing on its Austro-Hungarian border. Grey still holds out for mediation, appealing to Paul Cambon, ambassador to France, Russia's ally, not to let his country be goaded into war but Churchill surmises that Germany is trying to manipulate the French, playing on losses in the Franco-Prussian War forty years earlier. The British cabinet is split over the best course of action though Grey still desires Anglo-French neutrality in any conflict between Germany and Russia. He sends his peace plan to Germany and it appears to be successful but in reality Europe is only four days away from war. Rivers of Blood is one of the best known but least understood speeches in British political history. In this documentary the fragments of filmed speech that survive are brought together and Enoch Powell's argument is examined in detail. Powell prophesied that mass migration would lead to segregation and communal violence, but the incendiary nature of his language dominated the headlines. His core argument was largely ignored. This film examines Powell's character and the fears that drove him to make his fateful speech. We see how his words bitterly divided the nation, and see why Powell was cast out into the political wilderness, with his speech becoming a byword for racism. On the 40th anniversary of Rivers of Blood, this film explores the controversial claims and counter-claims surrounding one of Britain's most divisive politicians, and perhaps the most infamous speech in modern political history. The interviewees include: Frank Field MP, Professor Stuart Hall, Lord Hattersley, Simon Heffer, Lord Heseltine, Lord Hurd, Lord Lester QC, Kenan Malik, Lord Parekh, Professor Roger Scruton, Ambalavaner Sivanandan and Baroness Lola Young. Contains some strong language.

Later Sally also has a nightmare and also ends up high on pills. Tommy and Harry desperately try to contact the Big Giant Head so they can go back to their home planet for emergency maintenance.

Don gives Dick a gift for his birthday and Dick tells Harry, Sally and Tommy to throw him a surprise birthday party tomorrow.

She first claims to be auditing his class, then tells Dick she's a reporter who wants to interview him because of his scholarship and after that she says she's an intellectual groupie. Because his ego is boosted, Dick loves spending time with her. So do Harry, Tommy and Sally, because Charlotte helps them with the surprise party preparations. Unfortunately for the Solomons, Charlotte is up to something. Dick feels it's time for the Solomons to actually meet the neighbors because he thinks they'll learn much more about humans that way instead of just observing them. This will also allow for bad cook Sally to get some cooking lessons from the neighbor. Meanwhile, Harry constantly watches TV. After a day of shopping, the Solomons find their car radio has been stolen. At the police station Sally meets officer Don and finds herself highly attracted to him. The radio however is not found. When Dick is being mugged at an ATM machine it's enough: He loses all faith in humans and the Solomons start looking for ways to secure themselves and their house. Meanwhile, Tommy has been forced by Dick to play basketball, even though he's not exactly cut out for it. Dick has casual sex with a woman he met at the cinema and tells Mary and Nina and even his class. Mary gets upset about this and so does Bug, when it turns out it was his mother Dick had sex with.

While the crew starts thinking about what will happen with their earthly bodies when they go on to explore other worlds, it turns out the will of the professor states he wants Dick to speak at the funeral because Dick has always been honest with him. However, Dick doesn't want to speak bad about him and tries to find something good about the universally detested professor. In the meantime, Tommy spends time with some cheerleader instead of with August. While on the Earth to find out how humans live, a group of four aliens - that has taken on the human form - discovers humans are more complex than they had expected.

Meanwhile, a very idealistic Tommy becomes the editor-in-chief of the school paper. His ex August is also part of the staff. Dick is sick and tired of Jennifer and wants to break up with her. His first attempt at this fails, but this turns out not to be so bad for him when Mary tells him that seeing him and Jennifer together has made her realize how much she misses him.

Meanwhile, Don has asked Sally to go bowling. However, Sally hasn't got a clue what bowling is. Mary invites Dick to a murder mystery weekend and the Solomons join Mary to the mansion where the weekend will take place. However, the Solomons do not realize it's all fake and all the other guests are merely actors. The first evening, Mary falls ill and spends the rest of the time in bed. Then, the first murder takes place and the Solomons don't understand why everybody remains so calm while somebody has just been murdered. They decide they have to find out who the killer is. Mary feels communication between Dick and her should get better and takes Dick to a couple's retreat. Harry and Vicki also come along. Sally meets an Italian-American man named Sammy Marchetti, alias 'the Butcher', and is thrilled because she assumes he's a mobster. When he asks Tommy to bring someone a very important envelop, Tommy feels he's part of the 'family'. What everybody already knew, finally gets to Dick: Mary has him henpecked! He asks Harry to learn how to become a real man that doesn't take orders from his woman and they end in a strip club where the guys of Dick's class have a bachelor party while Dick should actually be at a party at Mary's house he himself organized. Meanwhile Sally and Tommy are frantically playing monopoly. Dick tells Tommy to start going to high school as he wants the four of them to act like a typical family. When Sally has the chance to go on a date, Dick tells her to go, since none of them had sex yet and Dick isn't getting anywhere with Mary. With Harry playing her date, Dick explains some things about dating and off Sally goes. She comes back a very happy woman. She didn't have sex though but her date promised to give her a call. Meanwhile, Tommy's teachers think he has an attitude and Dick has to come to the school to talk about it. Dick is jealous when Mary asks another professor and not him to host a college fund-raiser she organizes. Mary asked this professor because he's funny which leads to Dick trying to find out the secret of being funny so Mary lets him host the fund-raiser. Meanwhile, Sally is building a shelf for her shoes and Harry is mourning about his lost coat. While Dick and Sally are at Tommy's school to talk about Tommy not fitting in, the teacher asks Sally out for the school dance and a totally swooning Sally says yes. There is however one little problem: Sally can't dance. Meanwhile, the Solomons, lead by Dick and Tommy, are trying to find an ethnic group the Solomons could belong to. When Dick finds out Mary is seeing a therapist, he desperately wants to know what she says about him and he starts seeing Mary's therapist as well. Don wrote Sally a poem for Valentine's Day but Sally thinks it's from some obsessed pervert and asks Don to find the guy. Tommy wants to have sex with Alissa on Valentine's Day. He wants to rent a hotel room and make it very special because, after all, it is their first time. At least, that's what he thought, but it turns out Alissa already had sex. This makes Tommy a bit nervous: he might ruin the night. Then, Mary's rebellious niece Tiffany visits and says she and Tommy should have sex. Dick receives an invitation for a family reunion. Obviously, the invitation is meant for another Dick Solomon, but, after he finds out the family hasn't seen him in 43 years, Dick decides the Solomons and Mary go anyway. Dick feels it's good for them to have roots. Harry hits it off great with cigar-smoking uncle Abe, Sally feels she's becoming like a sister to cousin Michelle, Tommy tries to hit on cousin Janine and Dick discovers there's a reason the family hasn't seen Dick Solomon in 43 years.

Because he feels bad for her, Dick decides to organize a strike to make the chancellor change his mind. Dick delivers him letters of resignation of all the professors but to his surprise, the chancellor accepts them and a stunned and frightened Dick hasty takes his own letter from the pile. Meanwhile, Tommy starts at the pretzel stand where Alissa works. Unfortunately for him, working with his girlfriend doesn't really work out the way Tommy thought it would. Dick and Harry fall down a hole and can't get out. Tommy and Sally find out via the television and on location, Don tells Sally not to worry because a hole expert - nicknamed 'The Hole' - is already on it. Sally clashes with 'The Hole' because she thinks she can do a better job getting Dick and Harry out than he can. Tommy uses the interest people have for the drama to make some money. Meanwhile in the hole, Dick loses control while Harry remains fully relaxed. Dick wants to learn to stay cool like Harry. Despite the fact they've been on earth for about three years now, the Solomons have never filled in the annual IRS forms and therefore Dick asks Mary to help them. She calculates they owe the IRS 9,500 dollar. When looking at the numbers again, the Solomons think up the idea to lie on their forms so they'll receive money instead of having to pay. Unfortunately for them, the IRS doesn't thrust it and announces they'll audit the Solomons. This makes them terrified. They think the IRS will find out they are aliens. While Dick laughs at a magazine stating 'Harrison Ford (I)' (qv) is the world's most attractive man, Nina and Mary agree. They think Ford's hot! Dick starts to consider plastic surgery so he'll look as good as Ford and goes to a surgeon, along with the other Solomons. The surgeon tells Dick what his options are, declares Harry to have perfect features and asks Sally what she wants done about herself, which makes her so insecure she feels she should break up with Don because he deserves somebody who's hotter than her. Dick sees a friend in the new, and rather strange, professor Dr. Liam Neesam, but the feeling doesn't last long when it turns out Neesam is better at Dick in everything and twists Mary round his finger. Meanwhile, Sally thinks Don isn't interested in her anymore after she hears a woman tell Don he was great the night before and Don won't tell Sally what that was all about.

Meanwhile, Tommy and Harry are writing an episode of The X-files and officer Don finds out why Sally is attracted to him. While playing a sexy party game with Dick, Mary reveals she once had a fling with Vincent Strudwick, Dick's nemesis at the university. Dick is shocked and decides to get back at Strudwick.

Meanwhile, Don got a motor and while acting tough on a ride with Sally, he falls and ends up in the hospital, covered in plaster. While playing with a wheelchair, Dick falls down the stairs and ends up in a wheelchair for real. Going to school the next day he finds it's very hard to enter the building via the stairs. He starts campaigning for a wheelchair ramp at the entrance, even though Mary's told him there is one at the south side of the building. Meanwhile, Vicki visits and Harry is looking forward to fooling around with her. Unfortunately, she has decided to become celibate. After accidentally locking himself to a tree in a park when activists are protesting there, people think Harry is an activist. He even gets asked to run for city council and accepts the offer. However, his opponent tries to dig up dirt on him. Meanwhile, Dick learns politics can be very complex and he's not sure he'll vote for Harry or the other guy. Dr. Vincent Strudwick, a colleague of Dick, has written a book on physics that everybody considers to be pure genius. There are even some Nobelprice winners at the presentation of the book. While Mary associates with these brainboxes, Dick is jealous at Strudwick and decides to write a much better book on physics than any man has ever done before, just to get even. He realizes this will expose him as a superior alien being and he has to find another way to get even with Strudwick. Luckily for him, Tommy's girlfriend turns out to be the daughter of Strudwick. Meanwhile, in spite of the fact they've broken up, Sally and Don go to a movie together, as friends. However, after the movie they go to Sally's place and one thing soon leads to another. Out of boredom, Dick, Sally and Harry go to another parallel universe via the shower and end up in New York. Dick is a lawyer, Sally writes sex(y) columns and Harry is the boss of a major television network. They meet Tommy, who's known about this parallel universe for quite some time, who's very successful at _"Saturday Night Live" (1975)_ (qv). Because he feels the Solomons haven't done well on their mission, the Big Giant Head comes to Earth to personally chastise them. Thinking they might have become too human, Dick orders Sally to move back in and he tells Harry not to have a baby with Vicki. He also tries to prepare Mary for the visit of his old "college friend" because he's worried the Big Giant Head might think Dick has wasted his time with Mary. Meanwhile, Tommy and Alissa are starting preparations for their junior prom. Sally is the new high commander and feels she has finally gotten the promotion she deserved. However, the Big Giant Head tells her he made her high commander because of her looks, not because of her work for the mission. When the Big Giant Head makes a pass at Mary and she tells Dick, he's delighted to hear the Big Giant Head approves of her. This restores Dick's waning self-confidence. When he hears about the prom Tommy and Alissa are going to, the party and alcohol-loving Big Giant Head decides to be their chaperon... Dick finds out humans have birthdays and people should 'act their age' and therefore the crew should also get a birthday. This is no problem for Tommy, Harry and Sally since they feel fine with their body and the age that goes along with it. However, Dick, being middle-aged, doesn't like it one bit, especially since he really likes Lori, a student who thinks about studying at the university next year. This makes Dick change his hair color and his outfit. In a bar, Dick sees a nerdy student smoking. When he realizes the smoking makes the student cool, he takes up smoking as well. Sally is getting sick and tired of Dick overruling her all the time and besides that, she has a sore tooth. At the dentists office Dick is told he isn't allowed to smoke in the building. While searching for a place to smoke, Dick accidentally locks himself in and he's unable to find an exit. Now, Sally is the leader of the pack. When Nina can't have dinner with Dick because she's going to a Black Student Union meeting, he wants to come along and have the dinner afterwards. When she tells him he has no reason to come to the meeting because he isn't black, he doesn't understand. When Harry suggests there might also be a meeting for white people only, the Solomons end up going to a White Power meeting! Mary hasn't told her parents Dick and she aren't a couple anymore when they go on a trip to her parents. They agree not to tell her parents the bad news. However, other bad news does come to the surface. Harry, Tommy and Sally in the meantime help Nina moving. Sally gets the idea to move in with Nina and orders Harry and Tommy to re-move Nina's belongings as well as move Sally's assets to Nina's apartment. Mary is trying to be part of Rutherford's high society and thanks to Dick, she is given an opportunity. Meanwhile, Tommy meets a girl (Lorna) at school who shows interest in him. On the other hand, there are two bullies at school who regularly beat him. Since they like it so much on TV, Sally and Harry try wrestling themselves. Harry has been kidnapped and sold to a circus where he works as Hargo the Alien while the Solomons and Vicki are trying to find him. This task is complicated by the fact that the Big Giant Head has decided to shut down Dick's brain functions one by one because he didn't send a report that was long overdue. Because it is two years ago that Dick and Mary went out and had sex together, Dick plans a romantic dinner and everybody is invited. Vicki Dubcek is back and tells Harry she has been with another man, Randy, but that's over. Tommy turns out to be a brilliant cook and while Dick & Mary, Harry & Vicki and Sally & Don are having a good time at the dinner table, Vicki gets flowers from Randy and Harry gets a warning to 'watch his back'... Dick has jury duty. The clearly guilty but friendly looking defendant is the same man who offered Dick candy earlier on and Dick can't bring himself to declare him guilty. In a cafï¿½ Sally meets Seth, a dark, mysterious and British writer. Obviously much to the dislike of Officer Don, Sally's intrigued by him and copies his black clothing and British accent. Meanwhile, Tommy and Harry help Mary with her pre-verbal experiment for which they aren't allowed to talk for five whole days. Harry feels useless and upset when he figures he doesn't have a function the way the rest of the Solomons have. Dick thinks Harry needs a father figure to give Harry some guidance and starts acting as Harry's father. Sally has dinner with Mr. Randall and his mother and, to put it mildly, the women don't really get along. When Sally realizes she isn't Don's first girlfriend, she starts to panic and considers Don's previous girlfriends competition. She desperately wants to find out who's she's up against. At a party, Dick finds out what it's like to be the partner of the dean when nobody pays any attention to him and he ends up talking to the other wives of important faculty members. He decides to organize a fashion show to raise money to repair a statue at the university to prove himself. Harry and Tommy try to sell lemonade. The Solomons have been given the most crappy place in a restaurant in favor of Mark Hamill, who gets a nice place in the middle. Sally goes to him, fights him and becomes a local hero. Sally gets her fifteen minutes of fame with Harry as her assistant. Dick, who is proudly telling everybody he's in the school yearbook, is jealous at her instant fame while Tommy gets in trouble with the school bullies because of his sister's fame. Homecoming weekend is just a few days away and everybody has their mind on the big game the school's football team will be playing. Except for Dick, who doesn't see what all the fuss is about. Meanwhile, Harry gets a job as a security officer during the game, Tommy has a crush on his glee club teacher and Sally realizes she has no friends and makes Nina her best friend. Frank is a former student of Mary who's back in Rutherford for some lectures. Dick is very jealous at the way he and Mary get along and tells this to Frank. Frank tries to explain to Dick he hasn't got anything to worry about because he's gay but Dick misunderstands and thinks Frank's an alien. Dick tells Frank he is too. When Frank tells Dick there are bars for people like them, Dick is amazed and can't wait to go there. Meanwhile, Sally, Harry and Tommy plan a bank robbery. Harry finds a job at a video store. Tommy has to write a book report but figures it's easier and less boring to just rent the film. While he's at the video store with Harry it starts snowing. Meanwhile, Dr. Albright and Dick are going to Chicago where they'll both be given an award, but it turns out Dick isn't very keen on flying. At home, Sally is alone and afraid of the snow until a rather stressed Leon enters the house to turn in a paper for Dick. Sally tells Leon it's their duty to be fruitful and multiply to save the human race. The Solomons are afraid the end of the world has come because there are lots of traffic jams and people are hoarding food in the supermarket. It turns out it's all because of Thanksgiving. The Solomons haven't got a clue what Thanksgiving is but try to cover this up by giving a Thanksgiving dinner, helped by Mary, Mrs. Dubcek and her daughter Vicki, who has an eye for Harry. Tommy and Dick have a disagreement and Tommy runs away. When he sees two humans hugging, Dick wants to cuddle as well, with Dr. Albright. In their office he tells her this but she doesn't want to. The next moment her old boyfriend Jeff comes in and they just can't stop hugging each other. With this Dick learns what jealousy is. He therefore asks Sally to find out what women want in a man. In the meantime, Harry has taken a stray dog to the house. While helping Mary with something, Dick sprains his ankle. Dick sees the advantages of using Mary's feeling of guilt to get her to nurture him. Tommy tries to sell chocolate to get the school band to Washington. Nobody buys anything until Sally accompanies him. Harry is sick and tired of not having a room of his own and builds himself a tree house. The washer and dryer of the Solomons breaks down and Mary tells them about the laundromat. Tommy, Harry and Sally go there and immediately love it. Harry starts flirting with a pretty blonde while Sally and Tommy soon find out not everybody respects the laundromat etiquette's. Mary suggests she and Dick should find another couple to spend time with and they start having dinners and playing tennis with Gwen and Larry McMichael. After a while however, the McMichael's seem to avoid Dick and Mary. Everybody is exited about new year. Everybody? No, when Dick finds out people use new year to strike a balance, he does too and feels he hasn't accomplished anything the past year and feels depressed. Tommy organizes a new year party at the bar where Harry works. When Larry and Mrs. DeGuzman, his former night school class mates, tell him they still haven't found a job, Harry gives them a job at the bar. Don finally stands up for himself after being played 'like a fat cello' once again by Sally. Aghast by the way aliens are portrayed in a film the Solomons have seen, Harry feels they should tell the humans the truth about aliens. Harry considers a science fiction convention to be the perfect place and the Solomons go to the convention. It's their first time in a hotel and after they find out about room service, Harry, Tommy and Sally adore hotels. At the same time, Dick is feeling bad because he feels he should tell Mary he's an alien, but can't. Dick is fascinated by Jennifer, his new office mate, and, when he's told it's not fair to Mary, tells Mary he feels they should see other people. To Dick's surprise, Mary doesn't object. However, after a while, Jennifer's passion for Moliere and rhyming starts to annoy Dick. In the meantime, Harry, Tommy and Sally want to combine the comforts of the living room and the kitchen and move the furniture around to create the 'Klivingtchen'. Dick has run over a chipmunk and is very shocked by this. He starts being a vegetarian, orders the Solomons not to use anything that's made of animals and throw the things that are made of animals away. Meanwhile, Harry wants to be a boy scout and Tommy has trouble with August. He didn't ask her for Spring Dance and now she's mad with him. He considers writing to an advice columnist. At school, Dick hears Dr. Albright and Nina talking about going to a women-only study group and when they tell him he can't come, he feels kept out. This however doesn't stop Dick and he tries to figure out how to 'get in'. At the same time, Sally shops 'till she drops which annoys Dick because it costs lots of money and he tells her so. Sally is fed up with Dick telling her off about this and, together with Harry, she gets a job in a pancake restaurant. Tommy doubts if he should tell August where he really comes from. Tommy feels inspired by 'Jack Kerouac' (qv) and decides to go 'on the road'. Harry tags along with him and they end up working at a nearby gas station. Dick & Mary and Sally & Don go on a double date and when Dick and Sally start praising their lovers' bed performances, Mary and Don get rather embarrassed. Back home, Dick and Sally realize their bed performances weren't praised and think this is because they suck in the sack. Sally tries out for a nude photo shoot for an adult magazine at Pendelton State University over the objections of boyfriend Don. Harry tries out home nudism and believes clothing might be a scam. An enraged Dick tracks down a photographer who took nude pictures of Dr. Mary Albright twenty years ago but then has a change of heart. Tommy becomes enamored with a new lab partner. When Officer Don let's him take a look at a group of felons behind bars Dick tells Don he'll bail one of them (Eddie) out and fully rehabilitate him so he won't end up in jail again. Dick takes him home but he and the other Solomons can't conceal their suspicion towards him. Meanwhile Harry hasn't read the book he should write a report on for night school. Luckily Tommy has some sound advice for him. At least, that's what they think. Sally tries to help Mary with her dog problem. It's the first Christmas for the Solomons. Dick is enthusiastic at first, but after being halted by a cop while trying to take a Christmas tree from somebodies garden, he considers Christmas to be a sham. Meanwhile, Harry gets a job working as a mall Santa's helper and Sally becomes a gift wrapper. August told Tommy she's got a Christmas gift for him and now Tommy desperately needs to find her a good gift. The Solomons start doubting their normalness. When both August and Mary admit they can sometimes be pretty weird, the Solomons decide to become as average as possible. This means they move to an apartment building, Tommy gets his hair cut, they all start reading 'John Grisham' (qv) and wear the same sweaters. Meanwhile, a new professor starts at Rutherford University. To Mary's chagrin, her rich and spoiled sister Renata is donating a new wing to the university museum. Mary explains Dick and Nina how much she loathes her sister and Dick thinks up a plan to pay her back for all the grief she caused Mary. Meanwhile, with the money self-proclaimed philanthropist Renata gave them, Sally and Harry buy some new furniture and turn the Solomon's living room into a youth center. As it turns out, Sally and Harry's methods of handling a group of teenagers are a bit unorthodox, to say the least. Dr. Albright goes on holiday and Dick feels very lonely without her being around. She didn't leave him a phone number or anything and he very desperately tries to find out how he can contact her. Nina however, does have the number of Dr. Albright, but won't tell him. Meanwhile Sally and Harry are totally into skin-care products. Harry even gets a job promoting one. Tommy meets a girl named August. Dick eats a lot lately because he tries to compensate missing Mary. His effort to lose the weight doesn't work: he finds it impossible to stick to his diet. Sally has gotten a tomato plant from Mrs. Dubcek and starts talking to it and even names it. Tommy thinks August might be cheating on him and Harry volunteers to get to the bottom of it. Mary doesn't want people to know she and Dick are having a relationship because she's afraid people won't take her seriously once they find out she and Dick are a couple. Dick doesn't understand why it's so important what other people think of you and feels like he's lost her. Dr. Sutor advises him to ignore Mary in order to get her back. Sally meets officer Don again and she wants to join the police. Once again, Mary's father (George) has left his wife and has come to stay with Mary. When the Solomons are over for a visit, George and Sally get along well. Very well indeed... Meanwhile, Harry and Tommy find the vacant university radio studio and start broadcasts. Harry doesn't exactly make a lot of friends with his idea of talk radio. Mrs. Dubcek asks the Solomons to babysit her grandson. At first Sally dislikes the whole idea of babysitting but it doesn't take long for her to totally fall in love with the kid. This can't be said of Harry, Tommy and Dick, who are driven mad by the power and influence the child has. Mary goes away for three days and Dick persuades her to let him take care of her fishes. Tommy, Harry and Sally have a near death experience when in a restaurant, a chandelier falls on the table they want. This makes them appreciate everything the world has to offer like never before. Even the simplest, most for granted taken things make them sigh in awe. They tell Dick about it, but no matter how hard he tries, he just isn't able to see things the way they do. This makes him so desperate, he joins the annual hiking trip of the university staff hoping to have a near death experience there. Enlightened Sally and Harry start volunteering at a soup kitchen for homeless people. Mary thinks she might not be respected as dean by her colleagues and Dick convinces her there's a conspiracy against her, led by Judith. Dick and Mary decide to find out more about this by breaking into Judith's office. Meanwhile, Vicky feels bad for Sally because she and Don broke up and talks her, and Tommy and Harry, into a weekend of riverboat gambling. Harry's pet dog from the home planet, Pickles, has somehow come to Rutherford, in human form! Needless to say, Pickles stands out quite a bit. Sally has heard of a gynecologist, decides to see one and, when she finds out about the great bond between pregnant women, starts pretending to be pregnant. Being the eldest of the group while playing the youngest of the family has taken its toll: Tommy is sick and tired of being treated like a kid and decides to retire and moves to a rest home. Officer Don visits Sally while she's doing the laundry and accidentally steals one of her panties. He wants to secretly put them back, but this turns out easier said then done. After Mary told him she once dreamed of being a singer, Dick arranges a gig for her in a club. Tommy kisses a girl for the first time but catches a bug. This leads to the whole crew getting ill. This is especially a burden on Dick who wants to go to a wedding with Mary and has to hide his illness to her in order to be able to go. Meanwhile, Sally discovers the mother instinct and Harry dreams of Martha Stewart. Sally and Harry also experience what it is to sneeze. Mary is the new dean and Dick thinks this gives him power over colleagues as well. When he fires Lucy, the cafeteria lady who hates him, Mary tells him to apologize to her and tell her it was a misunderstanding. Meanwhile, Sally has lost her virginity but doesn't feel like talking about it with anyone, which makes her uncertain and leaves Tommy and Harry wondering if Don has done something to Sally. Mary has a new parking place that's much closer to the entrance of the university. Dick feels he should have gotten the spot and tells the president of the university that he will quit his job if he won't get a better parking place. To Dick's surprise, the president let's him go and Dick ends up working at Rusty's Burgers. Meanwhile, Harry has lost his memory because he was blown of the roof by a storm and feels threatened by the others when he finds out they are aliens. Tommy's school performs Romeo and Juliet and after finding out August wants the part of Juliet, Tommy enlists Dick as the director of the play so he can become Romeo. However, Dick takes the task too seriously and makes Tommy the prop guy. Mrs. Dubcek is expecting friends and when she drinks a sleeping potion Tommy made, Harry ends up impersonating her. Meanwhile, Mary has 1,500 dollars worth of parking fines and Sally promises her Officer Don will fix it. To his own surprise, Dick has erotic fantasies about Nina. He doesn't know what to do until Tommy and Harry tell him it's absolutely normal to have erotic fantasies, even if they're not about your girlfriend. Dick feels comforted and even tells Mary about his fantasies. Meanwhile, Sally is under the spell of a cooking expert a la 'Martha Stewart (II)' (qv) and becomes such a great cook that an impressed Mary asks her to cater a dinner party she's hosting. When the Solomons need a plumber to fix the bathroom, Mrs. Dubcek tells Dick she'll arrange one, but only after they pay her the rent. Dick feels bled white and a feud between him and the Dubceks is a fact. A fact that forces Harry to choose between Dick and Vicky. Don believes Sally has hinted that she wants him to propose, which he does. Meanwhile, Tommy wants to ask Alissa out but can't find the right moment to do so. When she gets detention, an opportunity arises. After two years of dating, Don wants to finally kiss Sally. However, Sally says she isn't ready for it and, following advice of Mrs. Dubcek, turns to romance novels where she finds inspiration and tries to create a romance novel scenery to kiss Don. Unfortunately, nobody told Sally things don't always end up the way they do in romance novels. Harry and his fellow classmates Larry and Mrs. DeGuzman study for their night school exams. After finding out he is the only one who has to pay for crackers in the cafeteria, Dick learns the cafeteria lady hates him. Dick tries to spice up his relationship with Mary because he feels they are in a rut. Sally and Harry switch functions after a quarrel. Harry really likes doing the housework and the fact he now has a function, not realizing he's not very good at it though. Sally feels miserable just watching TV all day and wants her old job back. Tommy is agitated by the fact August is perfect. Dick has to get a routine medical check up, gets scared and runs away before the doctor can take a look at him. When he meets the doctor again at a Halloween party Dick leaves the party prematurely. At home he finds a scared Harry claiming there's a ghost in the house. Dick tells him there's no such thing but is swiftly convinced of the contrary after hearing a disturbing sound. Meanwhile, Sally and Tommy are at Mary's house to give children their treat. With Dick locked in the basement in an invisible box, his replacement becomes the leader of the Solomons. He is much stricter than Dick and seems to have some kind of weird plan. Harry and Tommy feel they should disobey his orders, but Sally insists that he, like it or not, still is their leader and that disobeying him would be mutiny. After a lot of trying, Tommy frees Dick from his invisible box. Meanwhile, Dick's replacement has a date with Mary. When Dick hears about this, he no longer has the strength to try to fight the other Dick. After the whole team has smacked him in the face, he realizes he should be strong and face his opponent. A fight follows and the good Dick wins it. At least, that's what the Solomons think. Mary has finally agreed to go on a date with Dick and it turns out be a very interesting date indeed. Sally finally has Tommy's teacher over for coffee and perhaps more. Unfortunately, the Solomons have received word from the home planet that their mission will come to an end because they have failed and that they will be replaced within 24 hours. The Solomons start packing and realize they'll miss earth and everything about it. Dr. Albright is very happy when she has succeeded in getting another, much bigger office that's for her alone. Dick on the other hand can't cope with this and tries to find ways to get her back in their shared office. When Mrs. Dubcek accidentally cuts herself, Sally faints and is brought to the hospital. In the hospital, Sally, Harry and Tommy are reminded of the TV doctors they know and start acting as if they themselves are doctors. When Dick is, once again, very harsh to his students, they file an official complaint against him. He starts taking sensitivity classes and the disciplinary committee awaits him. Harry's fling Vicki is back and asks him to accompany her to her high school reunion. Meanwhile Officer Don tries to teach Tommy how to drive. At the dinner table the Solomons are talking about the seven deadly sins. Tommy learned about them at school and learns the others what they are. Every sin discussed leads to a series of clips from previous shows to reflect how guilty the Solomons are regarding that particular sin. When Sally is told sex can lead to pregnancy, she doesn't know what to do. After some advice, she learns about birth control and starts taking the pill, but this gives her terrible mood swings. To complicate things further, she doesn't tell Don what's going on because she doesn't want him to think she doesn't want his child. In the meantime, Dick learns what tipping is but decides to change the concept a bit and ignorant Harry and Tommy become panhandlers. When Strudwick and Judith tell him they'll enter the Badger Day dance contest, Dick tells them he and Mary will also participate, despite the fact Mary can't dance. Harry asks Nina to enter the contest with him and both of them turn out to be great dancers. Meanwhile, Sally and Alissa become the best of friends and go shopping, much to the chagrin of Don and Tommy. Dick tries to get Mary back and wants to surprise her with champagne when she's in the school library. The real surprise is that Dick and Mary find themselves locked in the library overnight. Tommy, Sally and Harry don't want Dick and Mary to get back together and try to find them. They go to Mary's house, don't find them but decide to stay for the night. Sally even hosts a Tupperware party Mary was supposed to host. Dick receives a chain letter. Although he doesn't see the connection between a letter and having bad luck, he does hang on to the letter because Mary has thrown hers away and the only luck she now has is bad luck. Sally and Harry go to a hardware store. Sally has a problem with her toilet and she's helped by hunky employee Justin while Harry is mistaken for an employee by several costumers because his shirt looks just like the uniform of the store. Tommy wants to show Alissa he's manly and takes her to an ice hockey game. He soon regrets this when he thinks Alissa has a crush on one of the ice hockey players. Tommy has enlisted Sally in the school bake sale and Sally takes it just a bit too serious. Meanwhile, Harry feels bad about himself because he has failed everything he has tried so far. When Dr. Albright tells Dick she paints, Dick takes Harry to a class and Harry turns out to be a good painter. Dick on the other hand is lousy at it and for the first time experiences what it is to be less good at something than Harry. The Big Giant Head is back to take his son with him to the home planet. When he sees Vicky (who lost her trashy look, by the way) he instantly falls in love with her. She, however, hates his guts because he left her right after he made her pregnant. The Big Giant Head tells Dick to make her love him. Otherwise, he'll kill Dick. Meanwhile, Harry still loves Vicky but doesn't know what to do with these feelings, given the fact The Big Giant Head, his superior, wants her. Sally has her own problem: She's addicted to buying shoes. Tommy tries to help her. The Big Giant Head and Vicky come back to Earth. The Big Giant Head admits their marriage is rather troubled and Vicky feels attracted to Harry again. However, Harry feels attracted to Janice and wants to ask her out, which makes Vicky very jealous. For some reason, The Big Giant Head wants to spend time so much with Dick and treats him so amicable, Dick longs to go back to the days when he feared his supreme commander. Meanwhile, Sally thinks Alissa wants to dump Tommy and tries to protect him. Dick is totally astonished when The Big Giant Head turns out to be his father and he doesn't know what to do. Tommy's very angry with Sally when he finds out she dumped Alissa on his behalf. He now tries to do whatever he can to get her back. The tender relationship Harry and Janice have, won't last long if a jealous Vicky has anything to say about it. Tommy has provided none of the Solomons with a personal background, which is a burden to Dick because he has to change subject every time Dr. Albright asks him about his past. Ultimately she thinks Dick is actually an activist - currently hiding for the FBI - she met in the 1960's. Since she really liked this man, Dick sees no point in denying he's the guy. Meanwhile, the Solomons experience music because Harry has become a CD club member. Dick hits a tree with the Rambler. Because the Solomons don't have insurance, they can't keep the car and Dick hires a rental. The rental has a lot of gadgets Dick absolutely adores, but nonetheless the Solomons start to miss their good old Rambler. They are surprised to learn it's possible to get emotionally attached to a car. Meanwhile, a slick insurance salesman tells Harry to get insurance. Tommy and Harry find a wallet and return it to the owner who doesn't give them a reward for it. After Mrs. Dubcek tells them a trifle is the least he could do, they try to get their reward after all. Meanwhile, Dick feels ready to start dating again and after some advice from Sally he and Officer Don go on a double date. Sally also has a date and wonders how much a man will bear before having had enough of her. Sally feels she needs a place of her own and wants to move out. Vicki and Harry are thinking about having a baby. Dick feels he no longer has control over the mission and forbids Harry to have a child with Vicki and tries to sabotage Sally's attempts to find a new place. In the meantime, Tommy can't stop thinking about Alissa, a girl from school he considers to be his girlfriend. However, some remarks Harry makes, make him uncertain and he tries to find out if Alissa sees him as her boyfriend. Mary admits to Dick she's been studying the Solomons for the past four years (because they are a typical one-parent American family) and that she's now been offered the chance to make a documentary about them. Dick agrees, seeing this as a perfect opportunity to prove they pass for humans. However, the Solomons are worried they might be exposed as aliens and, during the filming, they almost are. In trying to cover up the secret they're aliens, they make up other secrets: Sally's a lesbian, Tommy wets his bed and Harry is an alcoholic. Dick tells Sally and Harry to get a job. Sally gets a job as Mary's research assistant. After spotting a mistake, Sally finds out Mary doesn't like to be proven wrong, which she is, according to Nina, quite often. This makes Sally decide to drastically change her attitude regarding her job. Meanwhile, Harry has found a job as a bar keeper and Dick desperately wants to become a cop after he finds out nobody likes physics while cops are respected by everyone. Pitman has asked Mary to be in a university promotional video. When she tells this to Dick, he wants to play a part in it as well and starts praising Pitman hoping he'll give him a part. Nina has an appointment with the dentist and gets a ride from Harry. After that, Harry takes her home and makes her some soup. It turns out Nina and Harry find each other very good company. Meanwhile, Don regrets the fact he gave Sally a key to his house because she's constantly around and doesn't care about cleaning up or people that have to sleep. Dick goes into business with Tommy after his nemesis Dr. Strudwick told him about the stock market and the money he has made there. However, Dick and Tommy are a bit naive when it comes to buying shares. A new cop has joined the force. Her name's Janice and she is tough, strong and, if you ask Harry, very sexy. Sally however is not that happy with Janice because she feels her position as the toughest chick in town is in danger. Dick thinks Harry watches too much TV and forbids him to watch TV for a whole week. The result is that Harry actually starts thinking, which shows a never before seen part of his personality. Sally finds a job as an assistant to a guy named Webber and it's obvious it's not her typing skills he admires but her appearance. After a quarrel with August, Tommy says he'd like to meet a woman of his own age for a change. When he's visiting Mary it turns out there's some sort of mutual attraction between them. Dick is devastated about this and tries to get Tommy away from Mary. Dick and Mary are both frustrated about their break-up and start a series of very childish practical jokes. Mary takes Sally to one of her yoga classes and when the yoga teacher hits on Mary and not on Sally, Sally desperately wants to make him want her. Meanwhile, Tommy reluctantly joins a band with some of the school bullies and Harry gets to be their roadie. When she can't go to a meeting where she has to speak, Dr. Albright flatters Dick in order to get him to go the meeting for her. After Dick discovers the trick behind the flattering he doesn't understand why people lie to each other. Sally and Harry are trying to get themselves a driver's license but discover it's not that easy to get one. Meanwhile, Tommy is upset because he has a pimple. Three years ago, Sally send in a request to the home planet for a male body because she hated to be a woman. Now, the Big Giant Head has granted the request and switches Dick and Sally's bodies. They immediately send in another request to be switched back but in the meantime they have to cope with the bodies ï¿½nd each other's relationship. Happy Doug has left Harry in charge of the bar when some tough looking guys come in. Tommy and Harry immediately suspect they are scum. Mary, because she's the dean now, doesn't have much time for Dick, which frustrates him. Jennifer, a new professor at the university, becomes Dick's office mate and he can't help feeling attracted to her. In the meantime, Sally tries to fix Nina up with Eric, a colleague of Don. At the bar where Harry works, Tommy finds a broken love tester and gets it going, but soon regrets having fixed the machine when it tells him he's a "cold fish". Dick feels the Solomons don't spend enough time together and decides to go camping with just the family. This means Sally can't bring Don along. However, Dick does invite Mary to come and tells her the rest doesn't mind while in fact, he just hasn't told them. Sally is stunned to find Rutherford's 10 most powerful men don't include her beau, Officer Don. With Tommy about to matriculate, Sally focuses her alien super powers on getting Don to be the man she can be the great woman behind. Dick can't bear for Tommy to go away for university, so he pushes to lure him to the local clown college, where Dick teaches. Commander Dick can't admit his empty nest anxiety, so he stresses the diploma mill's advantages, like his fabulous teaching. Dick insults Nina once again and she has had it with him. She quits. Dick gives Harry the job but he's no good at the job. However, Dick is too stubborn to apologize to Nina and goes on without a secretary. After she hears Mary and Nina talk about their childhood ballet, Sally decides to take ballet lessons to get a youth. She also starts playing with Barbies and forces Tommy to play with her. Tommy's mentor advices Dick to send him to a school for gifted students. This he does, knowing Tommy really doesn't want to go. In a bar, Sally meets a rather masculine guy named Glenn and they obviously feel attracted to each other. Sally however hasn't yet learned everything there is to know about the two sexes it turns out. Harry in the meantime tries to conjure, but it's still a long way to being a Houdini. It turns out Dick doesn't know the first thing about computers. After being made fun of, he gets himself a computer and after a while he understands and discovers e-mail and Internet and gets totally hooked. So hooked that he teaches his class via web cam and Mary starts to worry about him. In the meantime, Sally and Tommy decide to buy a new TV set. Harry and Vicki are still trying to have a baby, but when Vicki turns to the medical-science part of it, Harry can't get in the mood anymore. With a few of his colleagues, Don confiscates the Solomons' house so they can watch the neighborhood because they suspect one of the neighbors is a video pirate. When a state criminal investigator takes over from Don and his gang, Sally feels very attracted to this lieutenant. Meanwhile, Dick wants to know what it's like to be young and, while on a spring break holiday with Mary, by chance meets his students and starts partying with them.

First Episode! This week on 4 Points, hosts Alex Albrecht and Alison Haislip are joined by actor Zachary Levi and Justin Donaldson (of the upcoming Nerdist Channel show, Tournament of Nerds). They discuss how Google is taking over the cloud with the new Google Drive. Doctor Who is one step closer to reality with the invention of a real-life sonic screwdriver. Fans have spliced the popular video game series Uncharted into three feature films. Two men in Utah rigged up medieval booby traps in a national park. Post-apocalyptic drama. Seven strangers appear to be the only survivors of a mysterious, calamitous event: Los Angeles is empty, devoid of people. No sign remains of family, neighbors or coworkers. No spaceship hovers over the city, there are no zombies or flesh-eating viruses. Just seven strangers, who share the same iridescent blue mark on the shoulder, a tiny, precise square of color that wasn't there yesterday. Were they chosen? Or have they been culled? By whom? For what purpose? Their search for answers leads the seven to an even greater mystery. Why do they suddenly feel compelled to leave the safety of the city for an unknown destination? And why does the number 40 exert such power over them? Why are they being drawn towards whatever 40 represents with such compulsion, such longing? 40 is also a Lenten allegory. 40 can stand on its own as a rewarding viewing experience. Because it's structured as a Lenten allegory, 40 also provides fertile ground for prayer, conversation, meditation and study. Exile and journeying, loss and grief, hunger and thirst, mortification and fasting, sin and redemption, the path through the desert and the way of the Cross-all are dramatically "mirrored" by the story unfolding on-screen.

I don't want to feel like my life is over." - Alis. Sometimes a decision is made before it is made. Sometimes we know, but it takes time - and a shock - to make us listen to what we know. A month before The Dinner. The inevitable is written in every scene. Life is scripted, then improvised. 'The future enters into us, in order to transform itself in us, long before it happens.' From "we are totally happy" to "I don't know how happy I am" it takes less than three minutes. Seeing Felice so happily pregnant, makes Alis realize that she does not love Tomas as she said she does. She would never want to have another child with him - a shocking realization. 'I'm glad that me being embarrassing doesn't scare you away. I'm pretty embarrassing all the time. I'll probably embarrass you. Is that alright?' - 'I probably won't know how to handle it. Is that ok?' Maria meets Cybil, and her life changes forever. But what about Cybil's life? Who is Cybil, anyway? 'You've come into this world and you have rocked it.' Vineke is desperately seeking Peter and while doing that she finds Marc in Alis' apartment. For her he is to blame for everything that happened since he came into their settled lives. But is that true? 'Let's try to see what's best for your child,' says the mediator, but Alis and Tomas disagree on what's best for Sam. How could they not? They have stopped calling each other sweetheart, and now they disagree on almost everything. How do parents end up in court, fighting a child custody battle? Watch it happening to Tomas and Alis, as hurt, anger and frustration are taking the lead. 'Then you have the money thing, and the lawyers start coming in and out...' In a set-up you would not experience as such in the real world, but which is part of the way we are working here, Tomas' and Alis' friends and family witness the couple's interviews by the court psychologist - and they are terrified. They feel like they have to choose sides, they fear that it's contagious. and it's making them re-think their own relationships. 'Maybe there is something that's not working with us,' says Vineke. Is there? To be continued. "It just felt right, even if it was wrong." So Marc and Alis meet again. And again. So what is this? Fun? An escape from things that are no longer fun? How are you dealing with this? Why does your wife keep calling? Questions and lies and qualms start taking over. Imagine you are in love. She is married, you are married. Both unhappily, which is why this is happening. Then one of you decides to leave the marriage. And it is not you. Alis tells Marc that she is getting a divorce. Watch what happens. And if that is not too much to imagine: you are in a car. Meeting the love of your life. Or that is what you thought. Two hours ago. 'Why did you get married?' 'Because I was alone.' 'What happened?' 'I grew up.' After her scary interview by the court psychologist, Alis meets don't-you just-wish-for-a-delete-button-on-your-paï¿½st-Marc. Is she alone again? And what does it mean, being alone? 'You'd think that when love ends, that it could just end, and it wouldn't have to be so bitter and complicated.' Alis asks for Peter's help, Peter offers Tomas his help, Tomas wants everybody to get out of his life. A couple has common friends. One day they separate. What happens to their friends? Will they take sides, will they get involved, will they even stay in the picture? It's complicated. And sometimes bitter. What happens when 'our home' becomes 'my home,' when 'our child' becomes 'my child,' when 'we' goes back to being 'you OR I'? Rarely the decision is mutual, and the one who did not make it, feels angry. 'You broke up our family, now live with the consequences,' argues Tomas. 'You can't have everything!' 'I didn't lie, you know,' says Tomas after the interview by the court psychologist - and smiles. Does he believe the story he is telling? The story of Alis being an absent mother? Later: 'I still to this day can't even describe the betrayal.' Is that where his strong opinions come from? A character's short confession after a key moment. "This was not the plan. This was not how I thought this was all gonna go. I fucking put myself out there and fell in love and... I'm not enough.' Tomas tells his sister, Maria, that his marriage is over. 'Sam will be fine,' he adds, only for her to blurt out: 'Were we fine?' The seeds of the future lie buried in the past. Flashback: 'Tomorrow will look like today,' said Tomas in the very first scene, which initiated our long-running storytelling experience, exactly a year ago. Alis has just received scary news from a blood test, and she is convinced that this is the end. The crisis puts their relationship to the test, and Tomas persuades her to go with him to therapy. "If you want a happy ending, that depends, of course, on where you stop your story," said Orson Welles. Meet Vineke and Peter, a few months before the dinner. Vineke is Peter's second wife -- he left his first one because of Vineke, and deep inside she fears he will do it again. Can one love from a position of fear? Are we afraid of happiness? 'With that kind of happiness comes great risk,' says Alis, and Marc, in a moment of perfect clarity, asserts that 'ultimately I think I'll be unhappy by my own choice'. Watch Marc's and Alis' confessions after Alis has told him that she is separating from Tomas. What do they, what do we fear? Is it the unknown? Is it loneliness? Or is it, ultimately, our very own happiness? 'We keep saying that it's about Sam,' says Tomas - but it is not. A decision to separate, especially when kids are involved, is just the beginning. And what lies ahead is perhaps one of the biggest challenges life has to offer. It is Confessions time again, and we are focusing on Tomas and Alis after The Dinner. What do they want? And what do they think the other wants? Are they even on the same planet? Guilt, pride, competition, roles, habits, preconceptions... the list of obstacles to happiness is endless - is happiness even possible? In an unusual chapter, which combines a scene, the characters' confessions and a 'dialogue' after the characters have witnessed each other's confessions, Felice and Ike deal with sharing life together.

Owned by the mysterious Gavin Doran (Terry O'Quinn) and his sexy wife Olivia (Vanessa Williams), The Drake is home to dozens of residents who are unaware they're living in the dark embrace of supernatural forces. They think their dreams are all coming true, only to find they've been lured into making, what feels like, a deal with the Devil. When a young Mid-western couple - Jane Van Veen (Rachael Taylor) and Henry Martin (Dave Annable) - is hired to manage The Drake, they soon discover that evil, obsession, and manipulation has a home.
null It's Halloween and everyone is gearing up for the Drake's annual costume party. Henry is getting the hero treatment and being interviewed on TV. A media advisor, Laurel Harris, suggests he make the best of his 15 minutes of fame to improve on his career. Brian catches Louise in what may be a compromising situation. Louise may have a more serious problem however. Alexis tells him that she will stay out of his life. Flashbacks reveal the history of the man - or creature - from the suitcase. In 1929, in the midst of the stock market crash Peter Kramer comes home to the Drake to kill his family and himself. His daughter hides under the bed but a connection to Jane is revealed. Gavin meanwhile may be facing an unknown enemy when someone tries to run down Olivia. The man takes something from Gavin's wall safe. Gavin tracks down the man who stole the red box. It's an old enemy who wants revenge, but Gavin is determined to stop him before he can use the box to harm Olivia. Meanwhile, the police investigate what happened during the Halloween night, but they can't find any evidence to support Jane's story. Henry doesn't seem to believe her either, and their relationship hits the rocks when he suggests she should seek help from a therapist. Jane would like to move back to Indiana, but Henry wants to jump start his political career with Laurel's help. Also, Jane finally figures out her connection to the Drake. In a flashback to 1998, Nona's mother visits her mother at the Drake but goes into labor on her way down the elevator. In the present day, Nona's grandmother tells Nona not to let Jane leave. While everything is going well for Henry, Jane has come to the end of her rope and desperately wants to go home to Indiana. Olivia has a proposal for her however. Henry receives an award from the mayor for his act of bravery at the reception. Gavin suggests that he propose to Jane as a way of keeping her with him in New York. With Louise away on a photo shoot, Brian returns to his apartment to pick up a few things and runs into Alexis. He's convinced Louise was having an affair and succumbs to temptation. Jane may want to leave but the Drake itself may have other plans for her. The suitcase Jane found in the basement seems to be alive. A curious Tony DeMeo from the front desk lets it out. Henry's job has fallen through and he's in trouble at work being accused of leaking information about the polluted construction site Gavin was once interested in. Nona, the Drake's 14 year-old in-house thief slips-up and Jane catches on to her. She has some special advice for Jane about Henry. Annie Morgan's fictional Russian mafia hit man Kandinski - who she made up for an obit - turns out to be real and is keeping her prisoner demanding to know who betrayed him. Just as she is losing any hope of surviving, Gavin steps asking that she write an article on he corrupt planning commission Henry has been having to deal with. Jane finds that the wall of the Drake are infested with birds. She calls in an exterminator. She is also having nightmares where she finds a door in the Drake's basement. When she goes in, she enters a lovely bedroom - with a dead man lying on the floor. She's dreaming about a murder that occurred in 1956.

When Jen arrives with a box of donations for the mall charity clothing drive, it's not long before Jonesy's gotten his paws into it - finding some stylin' old duds of his dad's - aviator shades, a worn-out jean jacket and a motorcycle helmet. It's Christmas. Of course, this means there is mass chaos in the mall, from the top of Toy Mountain (where Jen and Wyatt are collecting gifts for children) - to the bottom of the mall Christmas tree (under which Nikki is hiding from her mother, who is volunteering at the Khaki Barn wrapping table). Wyatt's music - okay, his whole life has gotten a little dull lately.

Tired of Nikki always being right, Jonesy challenges Nikki to an I.Q. test. Of course, Nikki isn't the least bit worried - especially after patting Jonesy down to ensure he isn't cheating. Unfortunately, Nikki has no clue that Jonesy has an even bigger post-test scam planned. Nikki meets a great guy named Stone at the Grind Me coffee shop. He is nasty, sarcastic and negative - in other words, he's perfect for her!

The gang is in agreement - Jen is always butting into everyone else's business. In fact, they're convinced that it is physically impossible for Jen to keep her opinions to herself for 24 hours. Jen, being competitive in nature, decides to take that bet. When Caitlin hands the gang free cell phones that her father's company is testing, the guys take full advantage of all the free calls they can make. The only problem with the phones is that the keypad set-up makes it very easy to make "bum calls". Caitlin is sporting some fab new outfits these days - all gifts from her new guy, Les. The gang is happy for her and wonders if she has finally found 'The New One' - until they meet him. Les is bland, bland, bland - in fact, that's his name, Les Bland.

Like greed and lust, Envy (Latin, invidia) is characterized by an insatiable desire.

In Dante's Purgatorio, the penitent walks within flames to purge himself of lustful thoughts and feelings. In Dante's Inferno, unforgiven souls of the sin of lust are blown about in restless hurricane-like winds symbolic of their own lack of self-control to their lustful passions in earthly life. Wrath - Wrath (Latin, ira), also known as "rage", may be described as inordinate and uncontrolled feelings of hatred and anger. Wrath, in its purest form, presents with self-destructiveness, violence, and hate that may provoke feuds that can go on for centuries. Wrath may persist long after the person who did another a grievous wrong is dead. Feelings of anger can manifest in different ways, including impatience, revenge, and self-destructive behavior, such as drug abuse or suicide.

Robbie is told last, despite Camden's advice for her to be open, that that Mary has bumped into her ex Wilson, who does a course in Buffalo, and agreed to a dinner at his place. Robbie is doubly vexed as he immediately calls her after meeting a lookalike, Marie, also a basketball player, whom he asked over to get hold of her study notes. Matt meets and dates Cheryl before he realizes she's Robbie's ex. Mary also bumps into Lucy's Jeremy. While Eric sneakily prowls for pie, Ruthie tells off Jack, who indignantly rebukes Martin's insinuations as just that, even gets his and Eric's apologies. While Simon can finally just rest, Rose stresses he shouldn't find out her dad's fourth marriage is breaking up, like her ma's third, which is why he sells his house, which she hopes to get for Simon and her.

Matt is edgy, telling only his sibling he found an out of state summer job so he'll leave home in days, not months.

Mary rudely scolds Matt, unlike Wilson who leaves diplomatically, for getting physical at home, but her doctor notifies she's pregnant.

Eric can barely keep Annie from intervening directly before they know everything. As even Simon is near-broke and Matt can't keep up pretending he's a lawyer, the kids decide to 'borrow' enough from the twins' full piggy-banks to advance her all due debts. But creditors seeing cash convince her to 'refinance' over longer, which means even more interest.

T-bone proves a second Robby, as helpful as an angel and a butler, yet incredulous Annie can find him a home, at 17.

So the Camden parents soon learn the dreadful truth they already dreaded. After pondering how to help her, a family intervention proving she's still in haughty denial, the last resort is packing her off to Buffalo, to be taken in hand by the Colonel. Kevin feels Lucy is too lazy to shop groceries as she keeps promising, she hates him buying wholesale and throws out everything officially past its expiration date, he is pragmatical about his New Year's resolution to save money before they have a second baby. The twins spend $50 of their savings to help Darfur trough Nicodemus, a Sudanse refugee who once brought Ruthie home. The reverends oppose several -often old- votes by the deacons Lou tells them about on matters from office furniture for Lucy -which selfish priority openly disgusts Kevin- to whether Darfur is too political a cause to get the parish's financial support, planning an appeal to the parishioners at large. Ruthie arrogantly pretends her Scottish political talks make her an expert on all world problems compared to T-Bone, who never was overseas and has no PC but soon finds Margaret has doubts about the material Jane gave Ruthie and in mere hours learns more then Ruthie; he stresses nobody helps as much as the US, she it's never enough, he realizes the complex context. Kevin tries to educate the girls, who react emotively, yet shows generosity. Robbie panics when Mary announces she's returning for the summer months, so he tells her to follow parental instructions not to date her all that time.

Serena abuses her lonely birthday to make a move on therapist Eric, while hardware shopkeeper James Carver courts long-oblivious Annie. Robbie remains inconsolable since Mary left with Wilson. The colonel figures she won't go to college but marry and be a mother for Billie, so he insists on a job, preferably in public service, but he nor Wilson are pleased she opts for the police or fire department. Lucy refuses to explain why she left the New York seminary, apparently after a break-up with Jeremy, and Robbie is parentally dissuaded as consoling company. Annie works out her pre-menopause-frustration on Eric, inspiring him to take it out deviously on model-student Simon just for a bit of knavish attitude. Matt lost his hospital orderly job but soon gets another, albeit in a free clinic, mainly for (pregnant teenage) females. The mixed joys of fatherhood way heavy. While Annie tends to the flu patients, Eric feels no better after learning his pa the haughty colonel married after siring him. Martin's dad needs all his paternal love and self-control to patiently push the boy to step up to his upcoming paternity.

Martin has discovered an excellent reason for Ruthie not to date Jack. Eric's former 'apprentice preacher' Tom Harrison arrives unannounced, accepts to stay with the Camdens but is told the church can't afford an assistant.

Mary stupidly befriends party-animal Camille, a new schoolmate, who shoplifts a dress for her and convinces her to sneak out to a frat party. Lucy, who took Tom's cue to compare religions before joining pa's confirmation course, covers for 'big' sister and Matt must come rescue her. Eric's suspicions about Tom are disproved spectacularly. Eric was looking forward to possibly his last Christmas with the whole Camden clan, but wakes up a few days earlier in heaven as a rather Glenoaks-like town, welcomed by his loving mother-in-law and deceased people who appreciate the efforts he spent on them and their loved ones, and now worry about the mortals still on earth, including the Camden family which is preparing for Christmas, even Kevin and Lucy are back early from Frisco. While in heaven Eric is offered miraculous packed gifts for his family, all things he generously gave his parishioners, such as time for Matt and Mary to spend on their families and erasers for memories which poison relationships, his family decides to expand the day they spend on charity -like every year- to three: one because it feels good, one as Eric's favorite present and one for the infant Jezus. The best may be his own gift: everybody has a bunch of guardian-angles, and the experienced one in charge of his paperwork is processing an application from colleague Stanley to grant his -suggested- wish to get more time alive on earth...

Simon feels needlessly guilty when Ruthie reacts to his warning the twin babies will make parental attention scarce by deliberately failing a test to make Annie coach her, so he bribes Ruthie, who even scams him for double. Lucy's biology grades are disastrous, according to Mary due to new 'best friend' Nicole Jacob, whom she catches cutting herself. Playing in the park with cute little Billie, handsome student Wilson West meets Mary and both get butterflies. Wilson's impeccable charm, doctor-pa and record pass even Eric's paranoid muster, but on Sunday he divulges that Billie is not kid brother but his own son. At the airport to pick up maternal grandpa Charles Jackson, Matt is smitten at first sight on a girl he later traces and learns is deaf Heather Cain. They date, but she flees the party after some youths make fun of her sign-language. Eric and the kids welcome grandpa's new 'significant friend' Ginger, but Annie irrationally rages against any suggestion a successor for her ma could be less then diabolic. Wilson West tells Eric that Billy is his son, unplanned but not unwanted, whose teenage mother died giving birth to the angel, which his parents help him raise. Dating privileges are maintained 'for observation'. Michael Towner bravely owes up being the one who accidentally hit Mary when she dashed after Annie, who realizes she's the guilty one but only tells off Matt's overprotective vindictiveness. Sign language in a deaf-run restaurant helps Matt patch up with Heather. Jimmy Moon dumps Lucy on account of her endless hair wining. Charles Jackson nearly lost hope Annie would turn round and Ginger imposed 'a break', but both women come to their senses after some surprising 'counseling' and fibs. Mary is released home, but recovery up to basketball level is far from certain. T-Bone needs a drivers license to have some privacy with Ruthie, so he asks Kevin to give him practice lessons, but gets a torture version. Annie doesn't believe Lou's announcement the deacons want youth-friendlier church services because of a $16,000 budget deviation, and even a publicity swap with a car dealership; ultimately the twins solve the accounts discrepancy. Mac needs a job to pay his part of a place with Margareth and Jane, so T-Bone gets him hired as ticket colleague. Reading about hunger put Simon off his food, in fact his gloom spreads to all Camdens. Matt is worried sick as Shana claims doing laundry at his ma's makes her realize they need to take distance, in fact on account of her disrupted family past. The parish receives a ï¿½20,000 check from elderly Sachiko Ishida, who refuses to touch it as blood money for her family's World war II internment, so Eric asks veteran Henry Muranaka's help. Cruelly, kids not only ostracize vandals captain Mary but effectively even Lucy. Ruthie demonstrates the power of passive abuse in kindergarten. Terminally sick preteen Steve suffers because his overprotective parents keep him constantly in hospital under permanent supervision. Matt gets the job, despite objections from Eric, and gives their 'wiser elders' a courageous demonstration in true altruist responsibility. Simon is selling sweets to save up for favorite comics magazine's action figure Tick. Subcontracting to Ruthie yields remarkable results comparable to the bank of Simon's excellence. Bakery company chief David Friel wants to commercialize Annie's family muffin recipe. The girls push her to accept as a feminist self-evidence, only to share in the bitter experience of self-inflicted job-household overload. While Annie is still way, reverend Eric Camden keeps behaving weirdly, so his nosy daughter Lucy forces her unwilling, privacy-respecting husband Kevin to help her find out what's going on. For once he gets interested himself as it turns out there actually is a lot to uncover, starting with the fact Eric bought the twins hamsters as a consolation because his disgust at their teacher Miss Margo's flirting made Eric take the boys out of school to teach them himself. Kevin even ends up taking his pants off as bribe for homeless Stanley to tell what he knows about the hospital episode. Wilson West has helped ingrate winer Mary trough the whole summer, yet she only grows ruder and refuses to try walking without crutches. Murder victim Chamber's widow Nora turns to Eric as last hope to arrange closure by meeting unwilling, unrepentant killer Martin in juvenile detention, which proves quite testing. Eric suddenly decides to celebrate his wedding anniversary by arranging at short notice a marital vows renewal to make up for the shaggy wedding, which only eagerly accepts without realizing it's misery for all other relatives and (their) guests. Simon worries the attic won't be ready in time to move away from Ruthie before school starts, but even after Matt's plan to make him believe it's haunted, accepts a six months delay for the brat's sake. Matt ultimately gets over jealousy for Heather's Canadian house-guest Ted Shields and invites both. Lucy agonizes over life as Jimmy Moon's ex and changes her mind after inviting him with his new girl. With Robbie still in Florida, Matt fails to warn Simon, who got paternal permission behind ma's back, for the angers of attending older boys' parties. Simon's mate Morris drives him home but hesitates to ring given spiked punch promises a killer hangover anyway. Meanwhile Lucy settles her mutual good/popular girl jealousy with Mary, but jointly attending a frat party nearly sees Lucy forced to drink. Matt and his friend Kevin contemplate joining a college fraternity. Annie purchases and old beat up Camaro and tries to get the family involved in fixing up the car as a gift for Matt. Meanwhile Simon feels depressed with his mothers impending pregnancy believing that the twins will be girls. He also feels left out with the girls now involved in fixing up Matt's new car. Eric tries spending some time with Simon, but it backfires when Simon believes that a young attractive single woman is flirting with Eric. Matt reconsiders joining the fraternity, but Kevin decides to pledge with or without him; leading to a shocking outcome. Simon is eager to resume the football season, but not to get the mandatory tetanus-shot, but also a master at scaring needle-phobic Matt who has to accompany him and could fake it. Jimmy Moon needs some tutoring, so Lucy gets Mary to do it, but son regrets it, fearing big sister is falling for her boy-friend. Eric wants the parish to hire fraud-convicted Ron Kramer, an organist to the choirmaster's taste, as treasurer. Lou Dalton's vestry considers that as imprudent as having no security system in church and recruits Annie to draft a budget before the matter is settled, even threatening to fire Eric. Matt shocks his family when he reveals his secret--that he is very close friends with a teenage pregnant girl, Renee. Right away Matt tells them that he is not the father of her baby, but just trying to help her out. Meanwhile, Mary is keeping her new boyfriend a secret from Matt. Lucy gets a surprise with her secret crush on classmate Jimmy Moon. Also, Eric gets a surprise of his own when he discovers his shoes keep on disappearing while Matt's friend Renee finds some help from an unusual ally--Eric. Finally, Annie reveals the shocking truth to Matt about his grandmother having leukemia. Robbie fears Eric will never give him a chance when told, now his and Mary's community service goes so well they can meet, but only at home. Super hot Brad Landers finally asks Lucy on a date, but she stresses over a time-clashing girls project. Simon looked forward to the 'guys night like it used to be' Matt promised him, but his sleepover proves a testing marathon of witnessing stressing over Shana's New York dorm. Annie's step-ma arrives reporting Charles has Alzheimer, he claims it's the other way around. Schoolmate Ben's family inspires Ruthie to fear an apocalyptic millennium bug. When they realize that Ruthie has a secret and T-Bone won't talk, the Camden parents fear her sudden religious interest means something bad, even if their denial of sex is sincere. After some prodding, the twins tell Annie, Kevin drags and bribes out of Mac, Lucy learns from Sandy and even Eric from Margaret and Jane that it's just tattoos, like Simon, Lucy and Mary at earlier times, supposedly all unknown to the oldies; again everyone tries to pretends to most others neither to know nor to have told, then the game shifts to guessing who knows what and who should tell Eric (his heart!) or not... Simon's gentle schoolmate Stan sleeps over but has a horrid nightmare. Simon promises to keep his friend's secret but big brother Matt, who already suspected the boy's weird sister Lauren 'Babydoll', spills the beans to dad, who informs the incredulous parents she's in a street gang. The girls fuzz about mall shopping, and Lucy's secretive romantic reason. Eric and Annie rush to the hospital after Eric wakes up with a good feeling about his heart condition. Unsure whether her parents are at the hospital due to good news or bad news, Lucy is a bundle of nerves, and it's up to Kevin to keep her thinking positively as they wait for news. T-Bone and Ruthie decide to get back together, but Martin hopes to change Ruthie's mind when he reveals that he's in love with her as well. The wedding preparations inspire Simon's parents to reminisce about when they all were much younger. After Rose tells Simon she's late, he prays as passionately that he will make the right decision about starting a family as he did when his wish for a dog was granted almost miraculously. Simon is disappointed that nearly nobody wants to attend his wedding, Rose somehow blames Umberto and keeps the doubts alive, while her divorced parents habitually blame each-other and fear she shotguns Simon. At the rehearsal dinner charming teenage waiter Paul surprises Ruthie: he's from Edinburgh and dates her. Simon lets his mate Luke set them up with the Murphy twins, who fall for his cool 'bad boy' image by association with Mary, but the vixens make the knaves join them in shoplifting and other mischief. Matt falls in love at first sight with a girl in a wedding dress, actually model Julie. Only Mike teaches Lucy how to handle gossip. Annie seeks comfort with a friend, positive thinking guru Robin, who turns out rather negative. When Ruthie's black new classmate Alex insists with teacher Porter to do his 'Famous Americans' report on his obsessive idol Martin Luther King, no other, even though his day was shortly before, baseball teammate Martin Brewer's innocent remark it's not worth risking his sports career for has absurd consequences, as if he, not Porter, changed the assignment to reports on 'Afro-Americans' only, which annoys everybody who already wrote on classics which return every year. Someone is so pissed off that Martin's car gets vandalized with racist language, which the model of fairness refuses on principle to clean up a coward's mess. Kevin gets his former colleague Phil, now the officer in charge of hate crimes, on the case, while emotions run high all trough Glenoak with schoolchildren and adults. Shortly before Thanksgiving, the parents are still not home with the twins, who also are difficult now Eric has a cold and Annie somehow already blames him for ruining the family Thanksgiving again. Simon has brought his pregnant fiancï¿½e Georgia Huffington home, but she refuses to tell anyone else before they tell his parents.  Later she tells him she lied not to lose him. Pregenant Lucy takes advantage of her condition and is moody, driving Kevin (who desperately tries to dress for a drug undercover job), and Matt, mad. Martin canceled camping because of the weather. Lucy faints in the supermarket, Matt's limited medical student knowledge makes it harder on the and Dr. Kline. When Ruthie calls from Puerto Rico, lonely as Carlos's family is occupied with the baby, Martin assures her Thanksgiving is celebrated in overseas territories too. With Halloween just around the corner, Lucy attempts to learn the truth about "The Mutant" Mike--a mysterious recluse who's been accused of murder. Meanwhile, Simon prepares for the "Annual Pumpkin-Carving Contest" at the church and badly wants to be in first place. Mary schemes to have the house all to herself when tricking all of her friends and family as to where she is going to be. While the family prepares for the church's Annual Halloween Carnival chaired by Annie, Eric has a bad attitude toward the whole holiday and discovers the real reason behind his hatred of Halloween while remembering a dramatic experience he had as an 11-year-old boy. While both couples, Annie and Eric, Patricia and Morgan Hamilton, spend a romantic Valentine's Day camping, Matt is left in charge of the rest of the family and allows chaos to rein in the Camden household. His preoccupation with his date and Mary's party allows the dog, Happy. to slip out of the house in search of her puppies. When a car hits Happy, the family holds a vigil, aided by a caring veterinarian. Simon blames Matt for the accident. Lucy is enjoying her first Valentine's Day with her boyfriend Jimmy Moon. Matt blames his first-ever bad grade, for the crucial course organic chemistry, on everyone and collect excuses to delay studying rather then seek help. Simon is desperately lonely again after Jim's ma absurdly blamed him, but finds unhoped popularity when helping Lucy campaign for ball queen. Eric worries more about a surprise visit then the obvious reason, another attempt to make Mary see sense now she's behind with her car insurance payments. Sandy has braxton-hicks contractions, after which she admits that a miscarriage would simplify her life, but Simon's fear that the truth is about to come out seems ever more warranted. Kevin and Eric worry (with reason) as Lucy, clearly over her head and incompetent, keeps insisting that nobody else should meddle with her 'client' Sandy. They have to tell her who has already found out and Kevin must physically stop her assaulting her dad, Edward Jameson (an alcoholic). Eric fears George Smith is about to find out too. Ruthie stupidly lies about her new date being '16', as Martin says his -huge- team's shortstop Brian is 18. Like every Christmas, Eric compromises the kids' fun by imposing 'voluntary good deeds' and cheating the draw of the family presents distribution. Matt is even pressed into a mall Santa job, with a jealously rebellious dwarf-size elf. Wade can't avoid a family event and his gift for Lucy stirs more absurd speculations. Mary felt lucky the soup-kitchen she's pressed into happens to recruit hunky Carlos, a homeless Portorican New Yorker who travels since his home break-up two years ago, but Eric arranges a speedy reconciliation. Simon takes it on himself to save Ruthie from loosing faith in Santa. Eric and Annie's second-hand or home-made gifts rule bites them in the asses, yet 'Santa' rescues them. Eric rightly predicts the kids only be/get more trouble in the new school-year, yet Annie enrolls for a college course. Simon has no friends at his new school, except fat Jim, whom he lets drag him along into minor vandalism, as gang initiation. Matt grudgingly admits he was stood up the a Vegas altar by Heather and lacks the heart to ask her again. Lucy's party summer is punished as Andrew, he toured in Europe because his dad wanted to separate them, made an irreparable mistake in southern France. Although Mary only starts at a minimal wage job, she buys a credit and still won't decide about college. Chandler has Jeffrey for the night since his grandmother is in the hospital. Lucy and Kevin celebrate their wedding anniversary and discuss starting a family. Cecilia makes plans for going to college and discusses her relationship with Martin. Simon isn't amused that Rose pulls all the stops out hosting a luxurious dinner to impress her Italian ex, Umberto 'Bert' Lanzo, who left her at the altar. He jests about wanting her back, or is he serious - and who is the mystery girl Simon agrees to talk to immediately but covertly? The Camden parents, are not amused that Ruthie's long-awaited cellphone does nothing for her social life. Eric urges the boys to call her, helped by unwilling Peter Petrowski's dad George 'Vic' Vickery and Kevin. Benjamin Bainsworth, meanwhile, finds her number and works up the courage to call after a year. Preparations for Matt and Sarah's wedding are being made and things aren't going the way Eric or Annie planned. Matt decides he will convert to Judaism after a discussion with Sarah's dad who convinces Matt that he can convert on the wedding day much to Eric's dismay. Annie panics when Sarah's mother tells her to expect 100 kosher guests to her backyard pot luck dinner. Ruthie and Simon begin to resent Robbie being in the house. Ruthie wants her bedroom back forcing Robbie out now that Matt will be moving out and Simon gets upset that Matt chooses Robbie to be his best man and Sam and David call for Robbie instead of him. Lucy gets upset that Kevin won't come to Glen Oak for Matt's wedding and Ben decides to propose to Mary after Mary starts giving him the cold shoulder. Eric and Sarah's dad the Rabbi go head to head and it seems Matt and Sarah's wedding won't go ahead after all. A month later, perfect house guest Robbie is getting popular with most Camdens, except Annie who childishly splits hairs about his domestic input, meant to help her but making her feel redundant, while Ginger takes care of grandpa. Matt is unwilling to stand by John when he meets the Carter parents and seeks refuge with Heather, whose boyfriend Thomas gets them off their backs by suggesting they're a sheets magnate family. Mary starts a round of panicking with a false rumor that Robbie is dating Lucy. Simon is flattered when Robbie asks his financial advice and starts copying him, even Matt follows suits walking around shirtless. Robbie finds a surprising job and the perfect thank you gift. After a scary arrest which could have gone fatally wrong, Kevin decides to leave the police before someone gets hurts as he can no longer concentrate on anything but his young family. Ruthie brings over Meredith and her presumed boyfriend Jack, who proves a natural with babies and a nice senior - too old, so - and is on to her plan; Meredith actually is more interested in the other good boy, Tyler, who agrees with a demure kiss to date. The colonel arrives, winking to Martin about his Iraq veteran dad's gardening job and to Eric's surprise already knows about Charlie - even got and believes Mary's version that Carlos cheated on her, but Carlos explains she just 'caught' him dining with Cecily, the nanny he had to hire because Mary was never home. Simon first scolds, then consoles his ex Sandy for having seduced and made a baby with Martin. Eric spoils the twins fun playing cowboys with granddad because he bans all gun toys and is told to bother about real problems. Lou Dalton tells Eric most parishioners want Lucy fired as his associate pastor. Even bright teacher's pet Simon is terrified by new bully science teacher Hunter to the point of faking illness to avoid a private meeting with her about his solar system model, which actually is part of a superb presentation. Softie Matt already turned down dates to the party after Mary's return to the basketball team, yet she bitches at everyone, even hunky jock ex Richard, who ends up making her day. Ben Kinkirk practically invites himself to stay with brother Kevin to see Lucy and their baby, knowing absent Martin's apartment is available that weekend, and tests the ground about him dating Mary again now she has left Carlos. Annie has the morbid obsession everyone should attend -fine for most Camden house-mates- a 'birthday party' for her late mother Jenny. This means barring Ruthie from seeing Vincent again, yet she's eager enough to visit him despite Lucy's warning while flower-shopping together. Ruthie returns in tears and tantrum, as if violated, in fact the kid only wisely took his parents' advice. Eric is excused from the party to help career woman Marie Wagner work out how to handle her mother's worsening health, while the ma -actually adoptive- wants to be independent, not a burden. The next Valentine's day, Robbie prepared a surprise for Joy. Mary meanly supposes the hotel she overheard him contacting by phone means another sex trap. Joy, who assumed the butler to be away like her father really is, isn't discouraged, but bitterly claims Robbie doesn't love her truly because he refuses to risk getting intimate. Matt contacts all his 'true lovers', wondering why he never stayed hooked up. Lucy again assumes Jeremy, who is back in town and double-dating with Mike, wants her back and pretends to have a date. Mary is shocked to see Wilson moved back and goes steady with her former school friend Corey Conway. Simon gets permission to let his hot senior date Maria 'help babysit' and gets her cute kid brother Jake to spare Ruthie dateless embarrassment. Simon discovers friendly, generous old neighbor Charlotte Kerjesz has concentration camp tattoo. Eric forbids Simon to ask her to help for a history assignment but realizes his son is right after hearing classmate Larry's father spreads holocaust denial. The Camdens are excited to meet Joanne, Matt's first girl since Heather dumped him. Considering her 'too perfect', jealous Lucy and Mary decoded flippantly to hate and ignore her. Joanne overhears them and dumps Matt over his lousy siblings, which stands even after apologies. Simon can't resists reading Matt's letters and thus discovers big brother is secretly married to Heather. Eric can't resist spying on both, and thus falls into a trap. Wilson won't say 'I love you' back to Mary, who refuses to understand he'll only say that again when even more serious then with Billie's late ma. Lucy's friend, new girl at school Laurie, is extremely timid due to her verbally brutal ma, but the scolding root sits deeper. After a love night, Matt has got married with rabbi Glass's daughter Sarah. Robbie is mildly amused at the fuzz of all other Camdens speculating and worrying whether Matt 'was dumber than Mary with Wilson'. Only Ruthie finds out, answering when Matt calls, but is sworn to secrecy. Meanwhile Matt and Sarah go tell her parents first, but she shies away from telling the truth and pretends they just got engaged, a lie they now have to extend to the Camden home, where the 'news' only adds to the mounting stress. Robbie's apparently firm happiness with Joy causes envy with his roommate. Matt is now in love with wedding plans, enough to vow his next steady date must be for keeps. Matt misses his date with a promising candidate, being commandeered for clinic duty. Yet thus he meets a fellow med student, Rabbi Richard Glass's daughter Sarah, who get doc's blessing. She insists they must meet each-other's families. Although both parents pairs plead against a mixed religions couple, the love-birds soldier on. All Eric's planning and fussing proves pretty pointless, with the whole family pacing and worrying in hospital and Annie bitching non-stop, while the animals are left unattended at home. Matt painstakingly works up the courage to donate blood, a phobia. Meanwhile Lucy breaks up with Jordan. Annie continues to suffer through her mother's recent leukemia diagnosis. Annie then decides to go to Arizona to visit them and see what is going on with them. Meanwhile, Eric volunteers for a charity work, but he's unable to do it at the last minute. Matt then volunteers to do it, but his dating habits get him into trouble with the organization he is doing charity for. Also, Mary decides to call it a quits with Jeff while Lucy has her first real date with her classmate Jimmy Moon. Lastly, when Annie returns home with her parents, they decide to stay with her and the rest of the family so that they could spend some more time with them--which unfortunately will be the last for Annie's mom, Jenny. T-Bone feels a bit insecure to learn the only thing stopping Ruthie from having her tattoo with his name removed by a doctor is lack of money while her parents firmly refuse to help pay and she is reluctant to take a job for her skin-integrity. When T-Bone generously offers to pay 'feeling somehow responsible' both Camden parents are lividly disgusted she dares agreeing and taking money he needs to get into college, and order her to take a job immediately to pay every cent alone. Lucy and Kevin find the church of her potential own parish, Crossroads, is inside the bar annex grocery store and school, there's about 27 inhabitants and Kevin would be offered the sheriff's star, appealing to the ex-cop. The Asian doctor who runs the complex cum church explains the parish gets about 100 worshipers from four church-less counties and different denominations, a town law stipulates residents must study and work there, all children are fostered because their real parents are in prison, the reverend's couple should act as their 'group parents'. Mac blurts out to Haley that Martin has no game that day, so she makes him admit his white lie in order to have a day off and hoped to spend it with Jane, reproaching Martin to dodge babysitting their baby-son Aaron as if her weeks of leisure didn't count. Jane is not amused to learn Margaret helps Mac writing his English assignment, and is obviously romantically interested in the cute kid; Eric tells Margaret she should concentrate on going to college, Mac agrees and declares like-liking her. Kevin is eager to move to the challenging parish, Lucy feels it's an awfully big one to chew, the locals hope they move in. Eric also assures T-Bone he is not at all obliged to stay with selfish Ruthie unless he really wants, let alone take any blame for her own stupidity. Annie hated receiving an invitation to Simon's 'disaster' wedding with Rose in May, until she realizes that's the same day as big brother Matt and his wife Sara's graduation from New York med school. Neither group will even consider another date, arguing that the other event is less important or troublesome. Ruthie considers taking a summer poetry course in Scotland to be with her ex, Peter, but dad won't pay and the phone-bill hits hard. Kevin plants the romantic idea of eloping. Rose's jealous ex, Bert, grills Simon about his mystery girlfriend and questions his commitment. Annie finds out and teams up with Bert, who talks Rose out of eloping as the Camdens would ruin this by attending. Yet the changes of plans and truth time up inspiring surprising changes of heart. The first weekend all seven siblings are home, Eric and Annie meanly plan to extend their child labor scheme to baby-sitting the ever-noisy baby twins, which only causes misery for the others without yielding sleep for them. Matt even accepted a menial deliver job in the dairy Shack, but can't stick it out with the owner's son as hostile boss. Simon enjoys ordering there, but Eric even steals from him. Mary slips away to meet Wilson and meanwhile 'non-dates' Jordan, while Lucy can only cover (pointlessly) by doing double chores. Lucy decides to run away, making Simon's guard job impossible, so even Happy gets neglected, while Eric just ignores his well-read parenting tips. The baby soothing solution proves musical. Three months later, already very visibly pregnant Annie shamelessly complains and acts as a tyrant to everyone, especially Eric, except Ruthie who lays fake pregnancy. Matt has given up an out of state college, but not moving out, so he accepts an invitation to become three girls' roommate, only to be blamed and expelled for their inability to resist his passive male charms. Lucy wins Mary's dare whether rules make dating harder by snapping up amazingly mature-built 17 year-old Jordan. Eric's endless misery trying to follow Annie's inconsistent whims and finding an appropriate wedding anniversary gift seems endless, until the gynecological examination yields news that staggers everyone: twins. The reverends get their spouses to handle the annual two-families-day so they can go play pool. In fact Morgan arranges finally to meet his wife's ex Kevin, who turns out to be a happily remarried Vietnam vet in a wheelchair. As Eric expected, all kids want to do things without any parents, so only the youngest are dragged to a cartoon movie by the moms. Simon is excited about his first 'making out' party, yet terrified when it's time to step into the closet and probably kiss. Scott is 14 but looks 18 and tutors Lucy maths just so he can successfully treat Mary to a date, only to be kept on a string. Matt is surprised that the jazz club John dragged him to is his mate's singer career bid launchpad, unamused to be asked as support against Morgan. Lucy has her own date Rick, but chose the same cinema as Annie. A visit from Eric's parents, strict Marines colonel John and his equally military wife, strikes controlled terror among the grandkids, and even Jimmy Moon, who initially discarded Matt's accurate imitation of the usual boyfriend-grilling. They come to present George, the charming, manly boy they adopted from an orphanage. But Eric discovers detective Will Grayson, whose death was faked in a witness protection program, is back in Glenoak after the crime king's death in prison. He claims his son, none other than George, back, as remains his legal right. After a fugue attempt from George, a creative compromise is devised. Matt meanwhile discovers aunt Julie is on the verge of an alcohol relapse. While even playing liturgical Elvis can only distract Eric momentarily from having to tell his parents about Charlie, Rose wants Simon to tell them about their marriage plan; there is a surprise visit. Lucy's first monthly sermon embarrasses the family by its personal content, antagonizes the congregation with militant feminism and bores by length. Rose pushes Simon to buy her a ring they can't afford and speed up their wedding by telling him she wants to wed first. Also his ex, college student Sandy, did it -once, when visiting him- with now uninterested Martin, whom she keeps bothering, but has a surprisingly serious reason. Kevin startles Lucy by wanting a second child and to become a full-time father. Ruthie schemes to matchmake Martin to Meredith Davies and 'take over' her high-school senior boy-friend Jack. Simon is verbally threatened with gun-violence by Johnny Morton, the just-dumped ex of his new girlfriend Deena Stewart. School regulations don't allow precipitous action, but Eric's police friends cues him the knave has a record, his family a registered gun. Matt is embarrassed with a black eye careless Mary's basketball got him, but his date Shauna's suave brother George Sullivan, who dates Mary, may be really dangerous, as product of a dysfunctional family. Jordan is patient with Lucy's weird idea about 'romantic' slapping. Simon sees no harm in accepting a 'non-date' with Diane until his girl Deena and her pa see them in the pool-hall. Lucy's joy to get her drivers license is spoiled by the silly picture. Cute, car-less Andrew Nayloss's proposal to pick him up for a movie cheers her up, but he expects the whole courteous, generous treatment girlfriends usually exact, plus a grilling from his dad. An apparently stray kitten seems to choose Ruthie to provide a home, but after lots of hiding the truth catches up. Matt tags along when Eric comes to hospital and takes Hank to dinner to discuss why pregnant Julie is with Annie, wining jealously about the gynecologist's female patients, including a supermodel. Thus they are out of reach when contractions start weeks early. Matt, Mary, and Lucy make plans to get away from the family for Thanksgiving, but when Eric's sister Julie comes to spend the holidays with them, plans are changed. After the family finds out about Julie's dangerous secret--her drinking problem--everyone decides it would be better to stay home. Eric decides to help his little sister overcome her problem at home rather than seek professional help--whether she wants it or not. Annie is not comfortable with the situation and is only concerned that the children stay safe after an unfortunate altercation between Julie and Simon. After a failed table-spread-trick before the arrival of his new magic kit, the great Simoni sadly inspires no confidence, hence can't recruit Ruthie, who absurdly wants to wear the cape even without aspiring to become a magician. Lucy eagerly accepts a fishy invitation from the 'cool girls', only to find it's a mean method to cause friction with her real friend, a fellow 'new girl'. Eric's church is in the running for weekly local TV broadcasts if next Sunday liturgy goes well, so writing his sermon is a worse obsession then ever. Jealous Mary sulks because coach Koper now focuses on another girl, even childishly announces she's leaving the team. While Annie is out decorating the church, Matt bows out of keeping order. After Ruthie calls the Colonel to tell so, he turns up unexpectedly to 'assume domestic command'. Still, a magic hiccup spoils the service. When Simon visits home to write a paper, the twins are just happy, the sisters speculate what trouble he's in; dad guesses his Bible reading is a pact with God for a clear bill on his venereal disease test. Zoe convinces Martin to join her watching a meteor shower for an astronomy assignment, but he leaves his cell phone afraid to tell Eric as it's at night, and thus misses a persistent caller- from Iraq. Lucy wants to return to parish work, but Kevin refuses to dump their baby on her ma, even prefers doing night-shifts or becoming a home dad. Ruthy's ex Peter Petrowski's parents George 'Vic' and Paris ask Eric to remarry them. Ruthy's boyfriend Vincent is offended she nags about Peter saying not to feel anything for her anymore. Simon invests in a babysitting course, but pays dearly when he lets Annie talk him into trying out on Ruthie, who already abused every older sibling even when much younger. Matt desperately seeks inspiration for a college project on sexuality. Wade patiently handles Lucy's insanely jealous and insecure worries after a -for him, unlike Mary, canceled- senior jocks sleepover until Matt comes to her 'rescue', then spontaneously braves Eric. Teenage mothers and (potential) fathers in Eric and Annie's church program go trough surprising hellish moves. The Camden home is surprised, especially Eric, by the arrival of Mary with her lover Ben, his brother cop Kevin, now Lucy's, and her new job as flight attendant which enabled their cheap flights. Still obsessed with Matt's secret, hopefully marriage, which Robbie and Ruthie help keep, Eric neglect his counseling appointment with the elderly Tallridges couple about their adult son Jerry's 'sudden' moving out, yet just that will inspire him. Eric is very proud when newspaper reporter Sam Robbins offers to cover his reverend's family. Despite warnings from the kids, the parents force all to collaborate, and but they end up betraying all the dirty laundry they warned their siblings not to betray. Matt meanwhile thinks that new orderly Elisabeth admires him, but in fact she only spreads malicious lies. Eric is released from hospital but drives everyone crazy with his pathetic enjoyment of every imaginable 'small blessing'. Simon man feels his stepping in as in the house is undermined when Matt joins the ridicule of him shaving and is tricked by Ruthie. Simon makes a commiserating friend, fat Jim. Matt still trues to get used to his early morning job and Shana is jealous about him spending most time there and with his roommate. Chandler's father is dying. Eric tries to get Chandler and his father to talk before he dies. Simon asks Cecilia to the prom. Ruthie has problems but does not want to talk about it. Mary has news for her father. Sarah thinks she is pregnant. Level-headed Robbie is the only one intentionally left home to baby sit the twins when the Camdens accept a first dinner invitation at humorist rabbi Glass's home. Mary beats Lucy to the punch faking illness so she can escape the event and try seducing Robbie, albeit in vain as he's loyal to Joy. Simon brings along his half-Jewish mate Morris, who fails miserably as good example for Matt and Sara as he hasn't got a clue about sabbath or other Jewish traditions.

In response to an incident of vandalism at a store, Kling tries to persuade baseball player Larry Brooks to start a ball club for young kids in the neighborhood he grew up in.

At the prom, Harry informs the students in attendance that any after-prom activities will be dealt with punishment, while Navid provokes a fistfight with Ty when he reacts with indifference over the pregnant Adrianna's unborn child which is in fact his.

As the title suggests, "A Bit of Fry and Laurie" is less of a specific format than a 'coat-hanger' for short sketches, starring the comical duo in various, recurring or unique roles: Stephen Fry, the sophisticated giant who usually plays the smug one, and comparatively small Hugh Laurie, usually playing the patsy. As a service to the public, Fry and Laurie provide two TV critics to deride the show. A lesbian-obsessed lawyer, a miserable English teacher, and a young couple who baptize their infant for business reasons provide plenty of fodder for the critics' self-absorbed rambling. As an added bonus, Laurie walks us through his very favorite sketch, and, with Fry's help, celebrates Swiss week. A man quizzes an Information Desk attendant. Derek Nippl-e reports a car mishap to the police. A conversation about the uniqueness of Language and how it defines us. Performance of the three word song, "America". A cad of a talk show host gets a dressing down by a guest author. Expositional news of blown covert ops is delivered to, and read by the rather pleasant commander of MI-5. A beggar is accosted for busking, which devolves into a debate of Classism and Democracy. An anemic program of Hand Exercise. Troubleshooting board members plot and booze it up. Fry steals Laurie's brain as a practical joke, but Laurie never notices. A pleasant Greek lunch is spoiled by Laurie's insecurity and lack of self-esteem. A tobacconist posing as a doctor prescribes cigarettes. The commander of the M.I.5 and his assistant are back for a chat, and two unwavering detectives demand to know the whereabouts or an unmarried woman's husband. An episode rife with controversy: several of the sketches are canceled after an audience member demands they are his stolen intellectual property. A teen poet helps his headmaster to accept the head's own repressed longing to express himself in metaphor. The polite M.I.5 boys return, and a young entrepreneur is denied a bank loan for his drug operation. Fry names his nipples, and, with Laurie's help, tells us how a floppy hat can save you from being killed by a bus.

As an added bonus, Laurie walks us through his very favorite sketch, and, with Fry's help, celebrates Swiss week. Highlights include a puppy who has had a hard life: the conversational pull of the Book of Genesis versus that of girlfriends' breasts; and a retirement home resident who, at 94, decides he wants to suck the marrow (or more specifically, the oral sex) out of life. The pleasant boys from M.I.5 are back to treat each other with love, and the taxation minister is heckled by no other than Tony of Plymouth, avenger of the poor.

Stephen and Hugh cope with the knotty problem of offensive language. They have uncovered a series of obscure words like 'pempslider,' a 'cloff-prunker' and 'pim-hole' which are extremely rude, but pass unnoticed by most of us because we don't know what they mean. Passions run high in the final program of the series. The day turns out to be very unlucky for Hugh as Stephen becomes irritated by his piano playing and kills him. But the irritation continues as the program becomes an obituary for Hugh and ruins the sketch. However, there is a happy ending for those who like that sort of thing. When Timothy is called into his father's study for a word, it is revealed to him that he is the chosen one and he must set out to kill Pewnack the Destroyer, the Dark One, the Beast - who lives in Saffron Walden. The show closes with Hugh providing accompaniment on the piano as Stephen mixes up a 'Whisky Thunder'. A pair of country boys perform their song 'There Ain't But One Way' which advocates 'kickin' ass' in order to solve most of the world's problems. Hugh reminisces about the variety of jobs he's had since moving to London including working as a freelance nudist and a couple of months in the white slave trade. A customer in a shoe shop is surprised to learn that the shoes are not for sale, but actually available for pleasures of the flesh, he is eventually tempted by Fredericka the moccasin. Stephen remembers 'The day I forgot my legs' and there is a special version of A Question of Sport's 'What Happened Next?' Jacobsen is called in to see his commanding officer in the US Army who is furious and tells him he is going to 'boil his ass in a bag, and have his ass for breakfast'. At an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting a new member stands up to confess his problem is that 'the starter motor seems to get stuck, especially in cold weather'. An angry customer attempts to return a copy of Jane Eyre to the bookshop where he purchased it, his reason - 'it's complete balls'. Once again it's time to mix another cocktail at the piano, Hugh plays jazz as Stephen conjures up a 'Beef Goulash'. The owner of a magic shop demonstrates some of his wares by cutting off his customer's finger in a trick guillotine, but he still manages to sell him some very realistic dog poo. Elizabeth Martin is cooking a selection of human ears, testicles and sweetbreads on her show 'Tahitian Kitchen'. Stephen and Hugh are joined by special guests Clive Mantle and Imelda Staunton to discuss everything from getting drunk to opening supermarkets. Stephen tosses a salad as he expresses his anger about a Shakespeare play he watched at the Royal National Theatre. Hugh performs a rap song about being nice to an old lady on the bus and Stephen puts forward his idea for growing a small but attractive town in garden in his freshly washed hair. The show closes with Hugh playing the piano as Stephen mixes his latest cocktail creation 'A Quick One for you Stephen'. The Young Tory of the Year National finals are taking place with contestants including Andrew Treadgold, who is reading Bigotry and Libertarian Nonsense at Exeter University. Hugh receives a death threat and Stephen warns him that it might not be safe for him to do his song. This series was set in a fictional Yorkshire town and based on the books by David Nobbs, the creator of Reginald Perrin and Henry Pratt. Each episode took place at a different social function (a "do") and followed the changing lives of two families, the working-class Simcocks and the middle-class Rodenhursts, together with their respective friends, Rodney and Betty Sillitoe, and Neville Badger. Now living apart from Rita Ted takes Liz to the Anglers' Club Christmas ball where everybody tries to persuade him to go back to his wife. Neville arrives dressed as Henry VIII,having lost his way to a fancy dress party and Rodney,his crisis of conscience having passed,offers Elvis a job at the chicken factory. Both Rita and Laurence turn up and Rita's rendition of a Christmas carol shows how popular she is with everybody,finally leaving with Laurence. Furthermore Ted is accused of cheating in order to win the Wisbech fishing contest and is forced to resign as club chairman. All the guests leave early and he admits to Liz that the evening has been a total disaster. Ted is now bankrupt and Liz has left him,incurring Rita's scorn when they all meet at a charity evening to raise money for the local playhouse. Nonetheless Rita,now working as a secretary and fond of her independence,refuses to have Ted back and Liz is similarly unwilling to get back with Laurence,leading both husbands to suspect - wrongly - that Neville is more than just friends with the ladies. Paul,now the father of baby Thomas,is embarrassed when Carol,with whom he had a drunken one night stand,shows up. At the christening of Liz and Neville's son Rita,now a Labour councillor is a guest but Ted,the child's real father,who is not invited ,turns up with Corinna,to whom he is now engaged. Simon is horrified to learn that the married woman with whom he was having an affair is the wife of Neville's annoying nephew Andrew,Jenny announces that she has split from Paul whilst Carol feels that Elvis's ambitions as a local reporter is driving them apart.Sandra is upset to see Ted with another woman,leading to an outburst revealing to all and sundry that he is the child's father. It literally all ends in tears. Rita is marrying Gerry but Paul stays away from the wedding out of protest. The bride also fails to show but at the reception she announces that she does not want to get married as it would sacrifice her independence. After Gerry has left for the honeymoon on his own Rita also announces her intention to stand as a Labour candidate at the council by-election. Ted meets sophisticated financial advisor Corinna whilst Betty and Rodney are full of their latest venture - opening a vegetarian health food store. Rita is marrying Geoffrey though Liz,annoyed that Simon lost his job through Elvis,is hoping the bride will again fail to show. She is disappointed but Rita is staggered to find Ted and Sandra have married just ahead of her and both couples are having their receptions in the same hotel. The guests circulate between the two rooms with minimum hostility though Jenny dumps Elvis to go back to Paul and he fails to get back with Carol. He is further displeased when Simon tells him that,due to his actions,he now has a far better job but there is compensation for Elvis when Liz suggests a private dinner party. Ted announces that he and Sandra will be opening a mobile transport cafe,leading to an outburst which at least reconciles everybody,though Liz makes it clear she does not want Ted to see their son. Rodney and Betty end the proceedings by wishing that everybody lives happily ever after - though they express their private doubts. Rodney has now bought Ted's foundry,causing some bitterness, so that when Ted turns up for the crowning of Miss Frozen Chicken (UK) sponsored by Rodney's Cock a Doodle chicken factory he refuses to speak to him. Rita also falls out with Betty after pointing out that her extreme drinking is well-known though,strangely,Elvis and Simon become friends. After letting in feminist protesters Paul admits his indiscretion with Carol to Jenny,who leaves him. However the evening's biggest shock comes when Liz and Neville announce that they plan to marry,upsetting Rita,though she still refuses to reconcile with Ted. Ted and Rita are Laurence's guests at the dentist's dinner dance,where,due to a misunderstanding,they are the only people in evening dress and where Ted tries to drum up trade for his foundry. Neville is still miserable, Elvis - working as a waiter - still arguing with Simon and Jenny still political,prompting a drunken Rodney to give up his factory. There are shocks in store for both Ted and his wife when Liz tells him she is pregnant,Laurence tells Rita that he knows their spouses have been having an affair and Rita's father collapses on the dance floor. Ted holds a fancy dress party to celebrate his departure to Nairobi with Corinna,though she is conspicuous by her absence. Rita annoys Liz when both come dressed as Good Queen Bess and the Sillitoes advertise their store by coming as peppers. Simon proposes to girlfriend Lucinda but for Ted there is only bad news when the police inform him that Corinna is a bigamist and con-artist who has been arrested for tricking him out of his money. Paul has also been arrested for throwing an egg at the Prime Minister. Ted has to tell the assembled company that he will be staying in England after all but unsurprisingly gets no sympathy from Sandra. It is the day of the funeral for Neville,killed in the car accident that has left Ted in plaster. Liz wants the wake to be a happy occasion as Neville would have wanted but finally the mask slips and she and Rita have a heart to heart,resulting in their ending their feud. Elvis lets Simon know that he is about to expose him for corruption in supplying phoney mortgages to dishonest landlords and Jenny is still concerned about the imprisoned Paul,despite being his brother's supposed girlfriend. There is good news for Carol as she embarks upon higher education and Rita, when Geoffrey proposes to her. Ted,however,makes a fool of himself when he wrongly believes that Betty is making a pass at him. Betty and Rodney,along with employees Jenny and Rita,celebrate the opening of their health food shop and vegetarian restaurant. Carol dumps Elvis,who ends up with Jenny,one of several reasons to put a damper on Liz's evening,along with the fact that the new ring road Rita is supporting will run through her house - and the site of Ted and Corinna's planned bistro - and the discovery that her brother Geoffrey,an anthropologist returning to England after twenty-two years, is Rita's new boyfriend. For all that the evening goes with a swing,largely due to the vodka in the carrot juice,and Ted is persuaded by Corinna that they should open a restaurant in Nairobi. At the reception for the inauguration of the ring road Ted feels out of it when the Sillitoes offer him a job and Geoffrey eulogises on his sex life with Rita but feels cheered when Sandra agrees to give him another go. Liz succeeds in getting Neville jealous at the expense of Rodney,who gets drunk and denounces his new-found vegetarianism. Rita also denounces the ring road,for Paul is serving six months after the demonstration,and she discovers her true priorities,uniting her in opinion with Ted. The true hero of the evening,however,is camp barman Eric,who forcibly ejects a lager lout. Liz and Neville get married,though Laurence's recent suicide throws a shadow on the proceedings.Jenny and Paul have reconciled as she is pregnant again, Elvis is dating Carol and Simon,under Elvis's tutelage,having an affair with a married woman. The reception is held at a small restaurant where not only are the Sillitoes dining but Ted working as a waiter alongside young waitress Sandra,whom he is dating. He is terribly embarrassed to have to serve his ex-wife,especially as she too has a younger squeeze,the handsome politician Gerry Lansdown,with whom she announces her engagement as soon as her divorce comes through. Snobbish dentist Laurence Rodenhurst and his flirtatious wife Liz see their socially conscious daughter Jenny marry Paul,scruffy son of lower class Ted and Rita Simcock. At the reception Jenny argues ethics with Ted's friend Rodney Sillitoe who owns a chicken factory whilst his wife Betty gets drunk and melancholy widower Neville Badger tells anyone who will listen how much he misses his wife. Rita's father embarrasses her in front of Laurence,causing her to lament that the Rodenhursts must look down on her family though she is unaware that Ted and Liz are having sex in one of the hotel rooms.With Jenny's announcement that she is pregnant social niceties have gone and Ted's other son,brusque would-be philosopher Elvis punches Jenny's estate agent brother Simon. A Brand New Life centered on a millionaire father of three (Don Murray) who fell in love with and married a sweet blue-collar waitress (Barbara Eden) with three kids of her own. They combined families in Murray's Bel Air mansion in this Disney TV movie which led to a one-hour comedy series. Murray's kids (Byron Thames and Shawnee Smith- another son was away at boarding school) had been brought up free-spirited and liberal, while Eden's kids were used to a close-knit, conservative upbringing. Hijinks ensue. As Barbara struggles with law school, step-daughter Amanda brings home a new friend from college to meet her family. He is a deaf man whose extraordinary and positive outlook on life affects each of her family members in a very profound way. When Erika finds out that a 17-year-old classmate is pregnant, she's excited enough that her and her boyfriend want to throw a baby shower. The excitement soon changes when she realizes her friendship is in danger, when her friend has to face real commitment... and grow up. Talk show hosted by real-life married couple Jon Carroll and Nkechi Okoro. This show is about subjects that matter - plain and simple!

Down-on-their-luck, best friends Ashley and Madison struggle with their attempt to find a home... that doesn't get parking tickets. When they can no longer handle the perils of living in Wanda (Madison's crappy car), Ashley and Madison search for decent dwellings, encountering a parade of Los Angeles' "unique" individuals along the way. Finally, they arrive at what looks like a promising prospect, at the home of the lonely, 80-something widow, Edna Harboth. A Chef's Life is a character-driven documentary and cooking series. The first season consists of 13 half-hour episodes. Much more dynamic than a typical cooking show, A Chef's Life plunges audiences into the kitchen of a highbrow restaurant located in the "low country" of North Carolina. The series explores both traditional and modern applications of quintessential Southern ingredients through the life and work of the series' host and narrator, Vivian Howard. Vivian's skill in the kitchen is an equal match for her charismatic personality, radiating behind crystal grey eyes. Vivian and her husband, Ben Knight, own and operate Chef & the Farmer, a farm-to-table restaurant in Kinston, NC. A Chef's Life will broadcast nationally on PBS stations starting September 2013. Vivian goes about christening the restaurant's new "whole animal, no waste" program with two little pigs from Warren Brothers' farm. She uses everything - including the skin - and shows us, upon her father's recommendation, how to make her version of sweet potatoes with cracklins. Ben, Vivian and the twins pick muscadine grapes at a small local vineyard while learning the history of this native grape. Vivian visits Mike and Gator, her grape suppliers, and makes homemade wine. Back at the restaurant, Vivian makes a pizza with mulled muscadines, and Ben tests this new creation during their first stressful pizza night in the wine shop. Vivian and Ben rebuild their restaurant against the backdrop of the Southern harbinger of spring, the strawberry. Their twins go on their first strawberry picking excursion and Vivian and a friend develop a recipe for Coconut Cornbread Strawberry Shortcake with Basil Whipped Cream. Chef Vivian Howard and her husband Ben leave New York to open a restaurant in her small North Carolina hometown. Vivian revisits the Southern tradition of "putting up" corn and shares her method for making smoked corn relish. As the episode concludes, a devastating setback threatens their new life. Vivian goes to Cedar Island to explore the new culture of farm-raised oysters in the Southeast. She and Ben share plans of opening an oyster bar across the street from Chef & the Farmer in hopes it will be a place that adds character and variety to the tiny town's "dining scene." Vivian and her dad orchestrate their family's first-ever oyster roast and are blown away by how much everyone enjoys it. Mary Vaughn shows Chef Vivian the old-timey way to can tomatoes. Vivian prepares for a Southern Foodways Alliance luncheon at the restaurant where food enthusiasts from around the country are coming to study BBQ, and Vivian plans to serve them the "ultimate tomato sandwich."

Harriet Vane attends a reunion at her Oxford College and is asked by the Warden to investigate a series of poison pen notes that several members of staff have received. She takes up residence in the college and receives one of these notes herself. In the cloistered environment of the school, there is any number of possible suspects. In the absence of a motive however, it is difficult to determine if the culprit is a member of staff, a student or even if it is a man or a woman. When Lord Peter Wimsey visits the college - as much to see Harriet as for anything else - he agrees to assist in the investigation. What he finds is that one member of the staff had reason to seek vengeance. After her acquittal on a murder charge, Harriet embarks on a walking tour of the West Country while working on her new novel. She spots a man lying on a rocky outcropping and tries to warn him that the tide will soon cut him off from the land. Approaching him, she finds his throat has been cut. She cooly collects evidence from the corpse before it is swept out to sea and walks to the nearest village to report the death. She shrewdly also calls the newspaper in order to cash in on the publicity of her discovery. Wimsey and Bunter volunteer their services to help her in her investigation. The dead man turns out to be a gigolo who worked as a professional dancer in aa local seaside resort and was engaged to a wealthy middle-aged widow who is convinced the death is murder and not homicide as the police believe. Lord Peter Wimsey is struck all of a heap by Harriet Vane, a murder-mystery novelist who's on trial for poisoning her lover with arsenic. And when she's given a temporary reprieve, Lord Peter, together with his manservant Bunter and the incomparable Miss Climpson, must work against the calendar to prove her innocence. Not only has Lord Peter recruited Miss Murchison to help gather evidence on the guilt of Boyes' cousin and solicitor Urquhart, he's able to get a copy of the actual will by having Miss Climpson insinuate herself into Mrs. Wrayburn's household and ingratiating herself with the senile woman's caregiver by feigning a belief in spiritualism and staging a phony sï¿½ance. Even with this new evidence, it's still an open question as to how Boyes was given the fatal dose of arsenic. Lord Peter is increasingly committed to exonerating Harriet Vane and begins to grow suspicious that Norman Urquhart, cousin of Peter Boyes and nephew/executor of senile but wealthy Mrs. Wrayburn, has substituted a false will for the genuine one making himself the sole heir. Wimsey recruits Miss Murchison. Urquhart's secretary, to his cause and recruits a reformed Cockney thief to teach her how to pick the lock and find the real will.

null Respectable British sitcom from Independent Television about the middle-class in their middle-age. Short-lived (26 episodes) but much admired, the sitcom was all about the simple relationship between Mike and Laura, two fairly unlikely individuals to come together and form an unmarried union. Nearing 40, Laura (played by Judi Dench) appears perplexed most of the time... Mike sports a perpetual grin. The two come together at the insistence of Laura's younger/cuter sister Helen (at a party) and his sweet, inept and endearing character sparks something in the bossy, stubborn, big-softy Laura. They never quite hit it off but there's something there that keeps them together. Played by real-life husband and wife comedy duo, this ITV production was in the same vein as The Good Life, Butterflies and Ever Decreasing Circles.

However Mike and Elaine quarrel because she realises that he still has feelings for Laura. Helen wants to find a boyfriend for her socially inept sister Laura.

Later, they learn that he died. Soon after, Marcy, a police dispatcher, and a mother worried over her son's deployment to the Middle East, feels a malignant presence in her home, which is accompanied by lights flickering on and off. Eventually, she sees a man pushing two women down into her basement. All three are ghosts. Randy puts his wife's experiences down to fatigue. But soon he sees and hears the male ghost himself. Meanwhile, the two of them are working as extras on a Western as a means of putting their supernatural troubles out of their minds. During the shoot, they meet a paranormal investigator, who is finally able to shed some light on this terrible phenomena. Since she was a girl, Rebecca has been able to see the dead. Her own great-grandfather, who died when she was six months old, was her best friend when she was five. But Rebecca's gift frightened her father, who angrily demanded that she stop talking to people no one else can see. Rebecca blocked out the spirit world for the rest of her childhood and early adulthood, all through her first marriage. Now, as a mother with two children, who is happily married to her second husband, there is no reason for her to revisit a long-closed chapter of her life. Unfortunately, the spirit world breaks through into her consciousness again. Now she sees the ghosts of a young boy, a pilot and a female slave-owner from the 18th century. It's up to two paranormal investigators to help prove to her that she isn't crazy. Bobby and Addie Wilcott have a strained marriage that they hope will improve when they buy an historic house in New England. Their marriage is further tested when doors refuse to stay closed and the piano repeatedly plays by itself. The couple tries their best to ignore the strange occurrences until their 5-year-old son is attacked by an unseen entity. Paranormal experts Ed and Lorraine Warren, famous for their work on the real-life Amityville horror house, discover that the couple has a much bigger problem - a demonic presence that is feeding on the discord in Bobby and Addie's relationship. Their only hope... is an exorcism In the Hudson Valley of Upstate New York, Marie is a single mother who struggles to care for her three children, particularly Julie, whose birth defect prevents her from walking or talking. For the three years she has lived in her current house, Julie has interacted with invisible friends. Marie assumes they are angels. Eventually she meets a man whose company she enjoys and she invites him to her home to meet the children. His name is Chris and he has an ability to sense spirits. He senses something is wrong the moment he steps in the house. Soon, the family sees the ghost of a blonde boy. Chris and Marie try to learn about him and the other spirits in the house through a Ouija board, which proves to be a disastrous mistake. Later, a demonologist is the only person who can give the family answers when Julie shows signs of demonic possession. April James has always dreamed of renovating a Victorian house. When she and her fiancï¿½ Matt buy a historic home in Salt Lake City, Utah, they immediately begin extensive work to make it their own... unaware of a ghostly inhabitant that detests change. From the beginning, the remodeling is plagued with setbacks, and their lives are unsettled by strange events: April hears voices inside the house, and her son Brian witnesses something moving in his bedroom closet. As they struggle to comprehend what is inside their house, an angry black entity appears to them, determined to drive them out. The couple turns to a medium, who vows to help them fight the entity, and protect the spirits of innocent children who are still being tortured by him. When innocent people are attacked by entities from the supernatural realm, they rely on paranormal investigators to protect them from the unknown. These investigators rely on their studies, their personal experiences and, in many cases, their piety, as they assume the risk of becoming haunted themselves. Mary Vogel has been a spiritual counselor for ten years, but a recent encounter with the demonic forces her to question everything she knows and trusts. Violent nightmares invade her mind by day and unseen entities attack her body by night. In the church, which was once a place of peace and comfort, feelings of revulsion overwhelm her. Deep in her own mind, a diabolical voice taunts her: "Your God can't help you now" John Zaffis, one of the world's leading paranormal experts and Mary's mentor, quickly realizes what is happening to her. The protector has become the possessed, and only an exorcism can save her soul. The strength of the diabolical lies in the power of deception. In subtle ways, it destroys the bonds of friendship and family, distorts the beliefs of the faithful, and takes possession of the living. Sarah Miller perceives that something supernatural lurks inside her new home, terrorizing her children, and causing her to doubt her own senses. Her fiancï¿½'s skeptical response provokes frustration, putting the entire house on-edge, as a sinister presence struggles to take control of the family. Sarah seeks help from a lay religious demonologist, who recognizes the symptoms of a diabolical infestation, and prepares an ancient ritual to expel the evil, before it destroys the family from within. Randy Irvin is a young man just starting out in life. He works as a mailman and lives in a house his father is renovating. When Randy and his father find bones in the basement of the house, Randy takes an interest in the occult. He buys a book on the subject, and using it, attempts to summon demons. Unaware that he has actually succeeded in doing so, Randy watches in amazement as his life begins to spiral out of control. When his mother and sister come to visit him, they, too, are subjected to torment from the demons. Unsure where to turn, Randy seeks help to rid himself and his family of these demons before it is too late. The Wheatsheaf Hotel located in the North East of England is a century old building notorious for sightings of ghostly figures by its patrons. The young owners of the hotel decided to seek for an answer via a Ouija board. Unknown to them, the Ouija board is not just a media of communication with supernatural beings. It also acts as a door for those on the other side to cross over to our world. By chance, psychic Suzanne Hadwin, who is a professional medium, and her colleague Lana Grabinskis, a spiritual artist, came by the Wheatsheaf Hotel. Almost immediately, Suzanne found that there were negative energies flowing through the hotel. Suzanne's investigation led her to discover the hotel's unknown and ugly history. Multiple killings had taken place in the Wheatsheaf nearly a century before, but the spirits of both the victims and the murderers still live on in this 100-year-old inn. The restless spirits' game of "Hunter & The Hunted" soon led to Suzanne and the hotel owners' involvement into finding out what was happening on the supernatural side of things in this old building. Mark Corvo returns to his childhood home with the intention of renting its extra rooms. But soon, his tenants report unusual happenings like doors slamming and unexplained footsteps. Mark attributes the sounds to the house being a century old, but he has also noticed that one of his favorite tenants, Ashley, has been acting strange. Her behavior becomes increasingly troubling, and Mark finally realizes that she's been practicing the dark arts in the attic with a new group of mysterious friends. He reaches out to the Ghosts of New England Research Society, who captures evidence of several entities and believe Ashley's dark rituals have opened a portal to the other side, inviting spirits into the home. They also reveal to Mark that he possesses psychic qualities that make him a target for supernatural activity. Mark moves on with a renewed sense of hope that he can control his abilities, although he will always have to keep the spirit world at bay. In Connecticut, Arne Johnson and Debbie Glatzel are a young couple eager to start their new life together in a rental house. They bring Debbie's young brother, David, over to help them clean it. But after spending a brief time in the bedroom sweeping, the boy runs out of the house in fear. He claims there is an old man in the bedroom. Later, when they are all back at the home of Debbie's mother, where Debbie and Arne are living temporarily, David claims that the old man has followed him there. No one believes him, but soon paranormal occurrences in the house convince them that David is telling the truth. It becomes clear that the old man is really a demon. At first he physically attacks David. Then he takes possession of the boy. The family calls in the paranormal researchers, Ed and Lorraine Warren, to investigate. They in turn call in a priest to perform an exorcism. Ben and Jaimie Shea find a beautiful 18-century home in Markham, Arkansas, which is hour outside Little Rock. Its one unattractive feature: pentagrams scrawled all over one of the rooms. Soon after moving in, the family of five, which includes an 11-year-old daughter, a five-year-old son and an eight-month-old baby, begin to experience strange phenomena. Ben, a male nurse who works graveyard shifts, is awoken by a baby crying on the baby monitor, even though the sitter has taken the baby and gone shopping. The five year old hears people talking in his room. The girl sees electronic toys turn on by themselves. Jaimie hears footsteps on the stairs, even after everyone else is asleep. Jaimie soon learns from a librarian who once lived in the house that it is haunted by the ghost of a young boy. He's harmless, she says. Unfortunately, since the librarian lived there, something else has arrived. It's a demon. A husband-wife-daughter team of paranormal investigators try to drive it out with a ritual cleansing. But it isn't willing to go. In the last 10,000 years, after the Ice Age, the rising sea turned the British regions into islands, largely covered with woods. Only some thousands Mesolithic hunters-gatherers roamed around. However, apparently in several waves and at several coasts, neolithic people invaded, importing sedentary life. The superior productivity of agriculture and other technology, as i tool-making, enabled the start of many aspects of civilization, such as ownership, socio-political structures and armed violence. They left the first monuments, still hard to read. The discovery of tin and its amalgamation with copper to produce bronze kicked off a continental trade explosion which put the previously peripheral British isles, rich in both metals, at the center. The organizational requirements of mining and resulting wealth stirred the emergence of a rich, leading class which presided over the erection of major monuments, some even as personal tombs. Bronze became the reference commodity, measure as well as medium of wealth and prestige beyond its practical use. In the Iron Age the productivity of agriculture and social buildup allowed people to invest in know-how, such as astronomy, and monumental constructions, of daunting scale, such as Stonehenge, such stone circles being numerous in and almost unique to Britain. Their assumed significance is multiple, partially reflecting social status f priest and nobility, partially (religious) efforts to give people a place in a cosmological context. Archeologists find footprints (in one case literally) of prehistoric people in Britain from different ages, waves and paleontological qualifications, as early as 5000,000 BC, including Neanderthals and even an earlier, distinct species. Homo sapiens arrived only the latest 31,000 years, but also in different waves, due to extremely variable climatological and geological conditions, mainly the stages of the latest Ice Age. Neil Oliver returns to continue his epic story of how Britain and its people came to be. Diving for 3,000-year-old treasure and pot-holing through an ancient copper mine he discovers how a golden age of bronze collapsed into social and economic crisis set against a period of sharp climate change... eventually to be replaced by a new era, of iron. Neil Oliver completes his epic journey through thousands of years of ancient history with the modern marvels of Rome. Digging beneath a London tower block, discovering building work from a massive stadium, and encountering the remains of an African woman who lived in York 1800 years ago - all evidence of the extraordinary multicultural modern world of Rome. Continuing his journey into our ancient past, Neil Oliver explores the age of Celtic Britain - a time of warriors, druids, and kings of unimaginable wealth. Neil encounters a celebrated warrior from 300 BC, owner of the finest Iron Age sword ever discovered. He tries his hand at divination in an effort to discover the power of Celtic priests and searches into his own DNA for clues to Celtic identity. In four chapters, largely based on and illustrated with archaeological finds and sites, Neil Oliver explains how, as far as is known, the Iron Age Celtic tribes known as the Ancient Britains evolved and entered European civilization. Their internecine tribal phase was warlike and partitioned. Overseas contacts, especially metal trade, brought wealth and progress. Ultimately, it attracted the superior Roman empire, which would conquer and pacify Britain into a province, like Gaul shortly before, but Caesar's invasion wasn't the definitive annexation yet, that was left to emperor Claudius; even afterward some Celtic traits and even rebellions remained. For about a century, Iron Age Brittons enjoyed wealth from metal trade and some Roman civilization they could buy with it. Soon after Julius Caesar conquered all of Gaul (present France, Benelux and Switserland), he invaded Britain over the Channel, invited by one the bitterly waring southern tribes. Soon all were smashed or had chosen his side, but he militarily retreated, content to have made them satellite vassals. Emperor Claudius would later invade again and turn England, soon plus Wales, into (a) province(s), a major prize in terms of mineral wealth, mainly minerals. This times roads and fortifications laid the groundwork for lasting imperial rule. Hadrian's and Antonine's Walls physically cut off the warlike, indomitable Picts of anyway near-worthless Caledonia. The Bronze Age, with monuments testifying to a glorious rich elite, declined quite rapidly once iron was around, stronger and more practical. Yet iron would only become common, more then bronze ever was, a few centuries later, perhaps due to climate stress. Whereas painstakingly produced bronze was a reference in its own right, beyond practical and cult use, to express wealth as well as obtain it, the easier, hence 'cheap' iron technology would 'only' enable a revolution in real agricultural productivity, allowing major population growth and spatial division, for the first time carving out single family-homes and plots as in historical times. Once the Celtic tribes were fully subdued and pacified militarily, the Roman rule brought a highly superior culture and technology, ranging from culinary to public works. Urban centers, forts and villas fully shared in those, but the rural majority remained largely unaffected except for stable administration and long-term unification on a national scale as province(s) within the intercontinental empire. By 1305, King Edward I of of England reasonably assumed that Scotland had ceased to exist as a political entity. William Wallace was dead and the Scottish king, John Balliol was in exile in France, a defeated and broken man. After defeating the Scots militarily, he allowed Scottish nobles to keep their lands provided they swore loyalty to him as king. The Church however played a decisive role as Scottish bishops had power that was independent of the English crown. An appeal to Rome had paid dividends when the Pope ordered the release of Balliol and recognized the Scottish crown. Balliol however refused to return and stayed in France, At that point, the Bishops were looking for a King who would resist the English. In 1306 they settled on Robert the Bruce and war was again at hand. The Scots were defeated and Robert was forced to flee. He chose to fight on and began to win battles. After the death of Edward I his son Edward II took charge of the army. Fighting continued for many years but in 1314, the armies met a Bannochburn where the Scots won a decisive victory. For the next dozen years, recognition of Scotland as an independent country rested to a great extent with the Pope but recognition came, finally, in 1328. Robert the Bruce died on June 7, 1329. In 1633, Charles I Stuart, a Catholic at heart, turned his belated royal entry in Scotland into a disaster by imposing a more 'lavish' Anglican style on its native, staunchly austere protestant Presbyterian 'kirk' (church). It's the prelude to a series of bitter, at times bloody conflicts. Key events include the 1638 the National Covenant, the 1640 war, the 1642 Scottish part in the English civil war. Similar religious strife occurred in the reigns of Charles II, James II, open Catholics in continental exile, and the protestant challenger, the Dutch usurper William of Orange, consort of Queen Mary. Alexander II became the King of the Scots when he was just a teenager. At that time, England claimed ownership of the Kingdom of the Scots but Alexander saw himself as an equal to the English king and he sought to free himself and his people from their English overlords. King John of England laid claim to much land in the north and Alexander wanted to take back what was rightfully his. England plunged into civil war when King John signed and then refused to the items agreed to in the Magna Carta. With angry English barons somewhat sympathetic, Alexander invaded northern England laying siege to Durham castle. and later laid siege to Dover with the help of French Prince Louis. On the death King John, the civil war ended and the barons supported the new King Henry III, all of 9 years old. For Alexander, it was the end of is support. The first border with England established in 1237. Alexander died on July 8, 1249. Upon the death of Alexander III in 1286 Edward I of England, claimed Scotland as his own. The Scots rebelled in 1296 but were defeated at the battle of Dunbar. William Wallace became a popular leader and raised an army of common folk to meet the English army at Sterling on September 11, 1297. They were defeated at the battle at Falkirk. Wallace was declared an outlaw in 1304 and was captured in 1305. He was drawn and quartered. The difference between the highland and lowland cultures are considerable and it all began as a feud between two families in 15th century Scotland: the Stewarts and the MacDonalds. Alexander MacDonald was lord of the isles and King of the Hebredes who had backed the Bruces and had the luxury of 10,000 armed men. It proved to be a time for artistic development with strong cultural and family ties to Ireland. Ties to the Scottish kingdom to the east were not so strong. James Stewart, King of the Scots, was a prisoner of the English from the age of 12. Scots were not prepared to barter for him - something the English had been doing for centuries - and even allied themselves with the French defying James' direct orders to the contrary. In 1424, the 30 year-old James Stewart was finally released by the English. James - woefully short of cash - met with Alexander at Inverness but it was a trap and the MacDonalds were imprisoned. Upon his release, Alexander burned Inverness and resigned his titles and claims to his lands. James then decided to extend his authority but MacDonald's men defeated and ultimately assassinated him. From that point the Stewarts gained ever greater authority until the time of James IV when he married Margaret Tudor marking the emergence of Scotland as a major power. Gaels however came to be seen as rebels and outsiders. Fleeing the usurper William of Orange, toppled king James II Stuart resided in Louis XIV's grand spare palace St.Germain-des-Prï¿½s, with a Jacobite court in exile. William wanted war on Catholic France, so he granted parliament a liberal regime. Scotland was ignored, in famine because of the war and denied the English colonial trade until William Patterson founded the Royal Bank - and trading Company of Scotland, which made a quarter of the country's sparse cash vaporize in the Panamanian Darien colony. Effectively paying off the impoverished nobles and promising religious and other freedoms enables queen Anne, succeeded to William after a fatal fall, to 'bribe' the Union treaty in the early 1500s. Louis's fleet would fail to bring the Stuarts in exile on planned invasions of Scotland, and after 13 years a long peace was signed. Impopular taxes stirred rebellion against the union anyhow, but even when dashing 'bonnie prince Charles, heir to James III, acted upon it without waiting for the French, his initial success was wasted by a war council already near London, instead the defeat at Culloden reduced the Jacobite pretenders to specters, while the Hanoverians who succeeded to Anne established the union to last. At Scottish king James V's 1542 death, his infant heiress Mary was coveted as a bride by Henry VIII to avoid his Anglican England being invaded by Catholic enemies from the north. Despite a treaty signed by nobles and an English invasion, her guardians got her exiled to France to the glorious Loire chateaus court. There she is betrothed to King Henri's son, dauphin Franï¿½ois - fourth in line for the English throne, (to hope for a Franco-British Catholic empire), but Henry's illegitimate daughter Elisabeth succeeds. Francois II's fatal ear infection left Mary a widowed dowager. Scotland turns Puritan protestant and therefore against Catholic Mary, who yet returns and charms her way into the nobles' favor by making her faith private. She weds English playboy Henry Darnley, who gives her an heir but is denied royal power and murdered, although by whom is unclear. After her second marriage the nobles force Mary to abdicate, Elisabeth imprisons her after an escape. Infant James is raised by Knoxite Buchanan, who doesn't spare his behind to instill protestantism and people's rights. After incarceration for being influenced by Catholic 'French' cousin Esme Stuart, James escapes, raises an army and seizes absolute power. James reigns as a skillful Machiavellian, survives the barren Virgin Queen and expects to subdue Westminster parliament, but only starts another century of Anglo-Scottish clashing, now within a semi-united Britain. In the 20th century, Scotland's old industry decayed even worse then England's. After the Great War arms effort, this meant low wages, high unemployment, dependency on British aid. Various opinions conflicted whether Scotland should rely on English solidarity, strive for full independence or accept an in-between autonomous status, known as Devolution. The last won out in the end, after the discovery of North Sea oil in the 'Scottish' part of UK territorial waters. The earliest history of Scotland is shrouded in something of a mist. Much of that early history is mythologized and seen through the eyes of others such as the Roman, Tacitus. Hadrian's wall was the line in the sand between Roman and unconquered Britain and the Romans only rarely ventured north. The Romans left Britain in 409 and the the Picts - or painted ones - were the dominant group. They were no wild barbarians but just as they vanished, Scotland came into being. The Picts were not the only group however with the Christian Gaels occupying a large territory. It's only late in the 9th century that tribal titles are dropped and the first monarchs of Scotland are identified. The 1764 Jacobite defeat at Culloden left Scotland divided and bankrupt. A Scottish diaspora throughout the colonial British empire (e.g. Culloden plantation on Jamaica), including Jacobite exilees, played a key part in building a rich, confident Scotland. Instead of fatal religious fanaticism, enlightened capitalist modernity was successfully adopted in science, overseas commerce, industry and society by self-made Scots, as studied by Adam Smith. Glasgow became their leading, opulent merchant port city, exploiting the colonies. Its small rich elite owning everything and wretched masses soon awoke literate protest against inequality at home and merciless slavery. Both helped sparkle the American Revolution. 1792 brought France and soon the continent its socio-political revolution, Scotland new sheep breeds which made the greedy Highland chiefs, by now London-based aristocrats, expel the farming clansmen to coastal crofts, which thrive on the new crop potatoes until the blight. Sir Walter Scott's novels revived Scotland's romantic feudal past now it was truly over. Hoping to stop class struggle, which failed as Radicals's attempted revolution, Scott invented the 'tartan traditions' for king George IV's royal visit to Scotland. But the emancipatory ideas would still win the crucial aspiration, electoral reform. Ana Raio is a rodeo queen in central Brazil, and loves cowboy Zï¿½ Trovï¿½o. But before allowing herself to engage in a love affair, she must find her daughter Maria Lua, kidnapped by the father Leopoldo Canjerï¿½, who had raped Ana when she was only 13. Having been invalided out of the Boer War, Paul Craddock buys Shallowford, a manor house and estate in Devon, with money from his late father's scrap-yard business. He soon becomes a much-respected "Squire" who is determined to treat all his tenant farmers fairly, unlike his predecessor.
null We all know Gauguin travelled to the South Seas, but what is less well know is that it was seeing images of the temple at Borobudur that inspired him to leave France. The sway of the human form in the Indonesian temple carvings can be clearly seen in his woodcuts. Down the road from Borobudur lives the contemporary artist Lucia Hartini. An artist whose work is inspired partly by European Surrealism. Alison Carroll questions conventional art-history view that a European artist inspired by other cultures is a genius, and an Asian artist who is inspired by other cultures is a copyist. Both artists have incorporated other cultures in their work. Both create unique art. Part of Confucian teaching on an ordered world is respect for your elders, both in age and position, respect for the order of the group. At the turn of the 20th century young artists were challenging this way of organising society. To do this they promoted the rights of the lowest member of Confucian society, the girl. Liu Haisu's Girl in a fox fur shocked audiences by depicting a confident modern young woman. Across the sea in Japan, artists were also challenging tradition. Yorozu in his Nude Beauty, embraced individualism. Alison Carroll visits Amanda Heng in her Singaporean studio and talks with her about how she uses 'touch' between women in her family to challenge the patriarchal aspects of Confucian tradition. In 1930s Shanghai the writer Lu Xun asked artists to create woodblock prints that showed the hardship of life. Woodblocks had been developed in China centuries before, but it was the more recent work of Kathe Kollwitz that inspired the return to the form. After the revolution, Mao could see the value of mass-producing prints as propaganda. Alison Carroll explains that the prints even helped to Chinese people to become literate. After the Cultural Revolution the prints become bigger and simplified. The strong graphic political style which developed was influential around the world, particularly in the 1970s, and Carroll visits Australian printmaker Ann Newmarch to discuss how this Chinese art practice spread into Australasia and influenced Newmarch's work. By the end of the twentieth century the graphic style of the prints had evolved into ironic canvas works that critiqued the regime, but were no longer created for mass consumption. In the 1940s in Manila a debate raged in the daily press about Modern art. Victorio Edades wanted to find a way "to blend and integrate all our impressions with our Oriental heritage and traditional Christian culture". The Spanish had been in The Philippines for so long that Catholicism was a tradition for them. Edades and his fellow artists also turned to pre-Hispanic imagery, inspired by the work of the Mexican muralists, particularly by the works of Diego Rivera. The sea trade routes to Philippines (and on China) went via South America, and ideas flowed with them. Alison Carroll talks with Filipino artist Nune Alvarado about the relationship between politics and the Catholic imagery in his artwork. Alison Carroll is in Brisbane, outside the Queensland Art Gallery of Modern Art. She is heading towards an exhibition by Cai Guo-qiang. Cai grew up in China, and he is a child of the Cultural Revolution. Carroll talks with Cai about how he artistic ideas came from Maoism, but also from much older, traditional, methods. In Seoul, Korea, Carroll talks with curator Kim Hong-hee about how art from Asia is leading the way in the international scene in the 21st century, and how it absorbs ideas from the East and the West. To understand more about contemporary art scene Carroll says we need to step back into the 20th century, and beyond, and understand that different cultures look at the world differently.

When a local man confesses to the killing, Bain refuses to accept the evidence and remains convinced Tate is their man. DI Bain and the squad have two murder cases to investigate. The first involves the death of two brothers, Lewis and Dafydd Pemberton, found at the bottom of a lake. The post-mortem reveals that one of the brothers was shot while the other drowned. The second case involves the death of Catrin Gwillym, the daughter of Sir Isaac Gwillym, a prominent local citizen. She is killed accidentally by by loggers but was in a pit with her hands bound.

When forensic evidence linking him to the murder is found, Bains is detained. Things are not going well for DCI Bain. At home, 17-year old daughter Hannah increasingly resents him as a policeman, all the more so that he had to arrest someone she had become close to, and packs her bags.

With a gangland war brewing and tit for tat murders, an arrest goes bad when armed officers shoot both Bain and Mrs. Tam, the suspects mother. On being released from hospital, Bain takes some time off and is unaware that the oldest of the Tam brothers, Matthew, has escaped from prison, apparently with only one objective in mind: kill DCI Bain. DCI Noel Bain and his team investigate the murder of Dilwyn Collier. He is found nude in the woods having been run over by a car, beaten and shot and near what was apparently a grave he was forced to dig himself. As the investigation proceeds, they focus their interests on a nearby ashram where Collier's daughter Joanna now lived. What they learn is that the ashram may be more a money-making enterprise and less of a religious center - and there may be an illegal drugs connection. At least one irate relative, whose wealthy brother has become a resident and generous donor, is convinced the ashram is up to no good. A second murder however shows them that despite what they've learned about the center, the solution to Collier's murder may lie elsewhere.

To Archie's surprise at the party, Margot now intends to marry Bottweil, not him, but before the evening is over, the designer lies dead, poisoned after drinking his favorite liquor. Although everyone at the party is a potential suspect, immediate suspicion falls on the unknown actor in the Santa Claus suit who mysteriously disappeared during the excitement. After Archie returns to the brownstone, Wolfe reveals to him that he was the enigmatic figure in the Santa outfit. After a deadly hit-and-run accident, a police officer questions two barber shop employees about the crime. Because Carl and Tina Vardas are illegal immigrants fleeing Communist oppression with a conditioned fear of police, they panic and run. When the policeman is later found stabbed to death with scissors in the shop, they become wanted fugitives. Archie grants them temporary asylum in the brownstone and finds to his surprise that Wolfe, himself an emigrant from Eastern European tyranny, makes them feel welcome long enough for he and Archie go about exposing the real killer. Orrie Cather, a private investigator employed by Wolfe, is engaged to be married but is cheating on his fiancee with a sexy ex-showgirl who is the "doxy," or kept mistress, of a rich man. After she steals his P.I. license and uses it to blackmail him, Cather asks Archie to help him out by getting it back. Entering her apartment, he discovers that she has been bludgeoned to death with an ashtray. Archie, Saul, Fred, and Nero all agree to work without compensation to try to clear their associate of the inevitable murder charges. When it is revealed that the dead girl kept a diary, involved parties are desperate to keep their names out of court. Archie then teams up with vivacious showgirl Julie Jaquette, a friend of the murdered girl, to ferret out the real killer. Photographer Richard Meegan angrily storms out of Wolfe's brownstone when the investigator declines to look for his runaway wife and mistakenly puts on Archie's raincoat when he leaves. When the gumshoe goes to his apartment to retrieve the outergarment, he finds the apartment house surrounded by reporters and passersby and learns that one of the tenants has been murdered. The dead man's black Labrador retriever attaches himself to Archie and follows him back to the residence. Surprisingly, Wolfe allows him to stay, naming his new pet "Jet" over the objections of Archie, who prefers the name, "Inkie." The animal and artist's model Jewel Jones, Meegan's ex-wife, help the detectives expose the killer. Noted orchid fancier Nero Wolfe hosts a flower show at his New York brownstone. A beautiful but inebriated young woman desperately wants to speak to the busy host but is diverted to his office by Archie, who is doing security duty. She confesses to him that she's a grifter and has recognized the killer of murdered socialite Doris Hatten at the exhibition. Archie does not take her seriously as he leaves her to help the boss, but when he returns, he finds the attractive young woman bludgeoned and strangled to death in Nero's den. The "Door of Death" in the title refers to a warning sign on a greenhouse dioor referring to the lethal gas used in the cultivation of orchids. Because his regular gardener has taken a leave of absence and orchid lover Nero Wolfe is desperate to find a replacement, the rotund investigator leaves his brownstone and takes a rare car trip to an estate in Westchester. He is anxious to close the deal with an expert orchidist to become caretaker of his beloved plant room. He is so impressed with the gardener's expertise that misogynistic detective even agrees to house the man's fiancee under his roof as well. Unfortunately they find her under one of the plant tables in the greenhouse dead from poison gas. Suspects include the gardener and the eccentrically dysfunctional family living in the manor house. The always fastidious Nero Wolfe inadvertently stains his tie while eating lunch alone in his study. While Archie is upstairs in the plant room trying to convince him to take on the prospective client, the beautiful young legal secretary is strangled in Nero's study using his abandoned tie by person or persons unknown. During the investigation Archie gets involved with a beautiful actress Rita Ramsey Sorrell. Wolfe turns away a frightened prospective client who desperately wants Wolfe to defend him after receiving a threatening letter. When the man is murdered hours thereafter, Wolfe fears for his own life after he receives an identical letter. He hires a lookalike to impersonate him at $100 per diem and waits for the murderer to reveal him or herself. The State Department asks Wolfe to help them out at the Adirondack lodge of oil magnate O. V. Bragan, hosting a trout-fishing weekend for South American diplomat Theodore Kelefy, who has requested Wolfe be on hand to prepare his famous gourmet trout recipe. Other oil tycoons are also in attendance in hope of securing coveted oil leases from the ambassador. Although Wolfe characteristically takes no part in the fishing component of the excursion, Archie is only too happy to try his hand at landing a prize brook trout. He is distracted by the beautiful and overly flirtatious Mrs. Kelefy, who is not shy about using her considerable charms on men other than her husband. Initially excited when he thinks he's landed a big one, Archie hooks the lifeless body of the Assistant Secretary of State on his line. Wolfe had hoped to exit the lodge immediately after preparing the fish but now finds himself with a more daunting task - hooking and landing the murderer. When rich, beautiful widow Lucy Valdon finds an abandoned baby on her doorstep, she is led to believe that her late promiscuous husband, a successful novelist who died in an accident, is the father. She hires Nero Wolfe to discover the identity of the the infant's mother and during the course of the investigation she and Archie find themselves increasingly attracted to each other. One of the clues he finds is an unusual handmade horsehair button, but when he tracks down the craftswoman who made it, she is uncooperative and soon after is found strangled. When Wolfe orders his operatives to set up a sting in Washington Square Park using the baby as bait, the operation finally bears fruit. When a farm delivery man is found bludgeoned to death with a pipe near a local restaurant, a box of the specially grown corn grown and picked to Wolfe's specification is brought to the detective's brownstone by Inspector Cramer. He considers Archie the prime suspect because both he and the delivery man were rivals for the affections of the corn farmer's daughter now turned fashion model. Although Wolfe initially tells Goodwin that he is on his own in clearing himself, the inconvenience of doing without his indispensable assistant causes him to get involved. The gourmet group, Ten for Aristology, meets for its annual celebration of haute cuisine prepared by Fritz and two chefs from Rusterman's. When one of the members, a lecherous Broaway producer, becomes ill at the table, his symptoms lead Wolfe to suspect arsenic poisoning. He narrows the suspects down to five of the twelve showgirls who have been hired for the evening as seductively-clad servers but needs the help of Rusterman chef Zoltan Mahany to identify the culprit. An anonymous young woman approaches Archie with the proposition that she be allowed to spend a week at the Wolfe complex incommunicado, and she is willing to pay well for the privilege. Taken by her beauty, the chivalrous Goodwin agrees to argue her case with Nero, who is characteristically angered to find a female tenant under his roof. The next morning, lawyer Perry Helmar tries to hire Wolfe to locate his missing ward, Priscilla Eads, who stands to inherit her father's factory and considerable fortune when she turns 25 in a week. Archie recognizes her picture as his young guest, but neither man reveals the truth to her guardian. When the young heiress cannot agree to terms with Wolfe, she leaves his protection and shortly thereafter is found bludgeoned and strangled. A guilt-ridden Archie looks for the murderer in the board room of the dead girl's company and is subsequently arrested for impersonating a policeman. Before Nero can free his friend and solve the crime, the killer strikes again. Idiosyncratic millionairess Mrs Rachel Brunner is sure that the FBI is bugging, following, and generally harassing her because she bought 10,000 copies of an infamous book criticizing J. Edgar Hoover and his organization and distributed them by mail to friends. During the course of their investigation Archie and Nero uncover a murder for which a G-man may or may not be guilty. Nero contrives to entrap the Bureau into a compromising situation in order to get them to cease and desist in their actions against the eccentric Mrs. Brunner. Wolfe and Archie are subpoenaed to testify in the murder trial of businessman Leonard Ashe, accused of strangling a phone operator whom he had asked to spy on his wife. Wolfe resents having to give testimony against a man he believes to be innocent as well as being uncomfortable having to sit next to a heavily perfumed woman in court. He suddenly bolts out of the courtroom in order to find the evidence necessary to cast reasonable doubt on the prosecution's case. His suspicions are confirmed when he discovers that one of the dead woman's co-workers is able to afford an original Van Gogh on her $80 a week salary. In 1946 post-War America, shortages and price controls are in the hands of the the controversial Bureau of Price Regulations (BPR). The organization is very much at odds with the National Industrial Association (NIA), which opposes its policies. When Cheney Boone, the leader of the BPR, is bludgeoned to death by a monkey wrench just prior to a speech addressing the organizations, NIA members are suspected. A broke and nearly bankrupt Wolfe is forced to take the case out of financial necessity, so he feigns a mental breakdown in order to but himself the time that he needs. After Boone's secretary, Phoebe Gunther, is also murdered, Wolfe is convinced that a stolen Dictaphone cylinder holds the key to solving the homicides. Archie agrees to help corporate executive Thomas Yaeger find out who's been following him to a certain address in one of the seedier area of town but later finds that his new client's dead body has been found in an alley near that address. After seeing Yaeger's picture, he realizes that the man who hired him was an impostor. Archie investigates the address and discovers a lavish penthouse apartment atop the otherwise run-down building. He quickly learns that the real Yaeger was a philandering womanizer who held virtually nonstop liaisons with a parade of beautiful women in this garish love nest decorated with erotic art. Wolfe is hired by Yaeger's employer, the Puerto Rican family that superintends the building, and the dead man's materialistic widow, all of whom have separate agendas and are all viewed as suspects by the detective.

Dalgliesh quickly determines that Berowne had fought with his brother-in-law Dominic Swayne who denies killing him. Dalgliesh is upset to learn that Travers was a Special Branch operative. Carole Washburn tells Miskin that nurse Teresa Nolan may have had information about Stephen Lampart's clinic. Insp. Miskin meanwhile rushes to the hospital when she learns her grandmother has been mugged. Dalgliesh visits the church where Berowne was killed and is surprised when Father Francis finds a button in the offerings box. Emily Wharton thinks it must have been young Darren who put it there instead of the 10 pence she had given him to go and light a candle. The Berowne's cook, Miss Matlock, clearly recognizes the button but says she can't recall where she's seen it. Halliwell the chauffeur tells Dagliesh that he drove Sir Paul's mother to the church on the evening her son was killed. They also learn that someone else went to the church as well. Darren is lured to a secluded spot. Desperate to get away, the killer takes Miskin and her grandmother prisoner but tragedy ensues. The crime series, inspired by the routine actions and criminal investigations, tells the story of the delegate Jorge Macedo, personal dramas and the way he dismantled a gang responsible for a major assault on an airport.

null DI Frost is an old-school no-nonsense copper who believes in traditional policing methods. Assisted by several officers including the ever-able DS Toolan, Frost uses what he knows about the street to find solutions to complex crimes as a member of the Denton CID. His home life is complex as he cares for his wife until her death and then leads a quiet bachelor's life, with only the occasional attempt at a relationship with another woman. His daily nemesis however is the Station's commander, Supt. Mullett, who is constantly worrying about budgets, staffing levels and crime statistics. He doesn't appreciate DI Frost's rough and ready manner, which doesn't stop him from trotting him out - with his George Cross, Britain's highest civilian honour for gallantry - when it suits him. DI Jack Frost investigates a series of commercial robberies. He's assisted by DC Carl Tanner, a black officer recruited by Supt. Mullett to encourage racial balance on the local force. When Frost makes an arrests on the local housing estate, Mullett's only concern is the culprit's racial background as he's concerned that the area not become a racial powder keg. When Frost's informant on the estate is killed, the case becomes a murder investigation, but all of the suspects are black and racial tensions are on the rise. In the course of his investigation, Frost determines that his informant had a number of secrets. Reinstated and again working with Sergeant Lawson, Frost has two corpses on his hands. One is that of a man found floating in the river with cash and a list of numbers in his pocket. The other leads him into the competitive world of ballroom dancing and Miss Dolores Delmonte, whose search for perfection in her partners goes to alarming lengths. Hazel Wallace returns from her training as the new Detective Sergeant. Supt. Mullett assigns her to sorting the mess left behind by DI Frost while he was on extended compassionate leave. Wallace's first case is a man found hanged in his home. She suspects the death was not suicide. A set of fingerprints at the scene belong to an unidentified man discovered drowned a year previously. Frost is summoned by Supt Mullett to sort things. He connects a painting that appears to have been stolen from the hanged man with an art robbery and murder several years earlier. Frost investigates the disappearance of 8 year-old Tricia Martin. The last person to see her alive was 19 year-old Billy Conrad who has Downs Syndrome and has the mental capacity of a child. He regularly played with children of that age and seems to be keeping a secret. Supt. Mullett is concerned about the number of car being taken by joy riders and expects Frost to do something about it. Frost has to deal with a new DCI who's idea of teamwork comes up against his own more individualistic style. As is usually the case, there's a lot on DI Jack Frost's plate these days. He's been assigned a new officer, DS Terence Reid who has been transferred somewhat abruptly after investigating a university student for selling contraband cigarettes. He has other problems as well, as Frost soon learns, but generally he is a good copper. Their first case is that of a woman, eventually identified as Sylvia Carter, whose remains are found on the railroad tracks after being run over by several trains. She worked for a local sandwich maker and Frost is convinced she was having an affair with someone. Dr. Helena Gibson, a senior surgeon at the local hospital in Denton, goes missing over a weekend. From all accounts she was in on Saturday but didn't show up at a colleague's house for lunch on Sunday. She was brilliant in her field but was disliked by virtually everyone at the hospital so there is no shortage of possible suspects if in fact anything is amiss. Lastly, Jack has a lookalike who is impersonating him and then touching and groping women. He is not amused, nor is Supt. Mullett who is worried about appearances. Having solved the death of Sylvia Carter, DI Jack Frost now focuses on the murder of a prominent local surgeon, Dr. Helena Gibson who was found in a plastic bag in a truckload of medical waste. According to the pathologist, she was killed with a blow to the head from a blunt instrument. Many at the hospital didn't like the woman including the hospital administrator, Jameson and several members of her surgical team including Dr. Retnick from whom she was demanding a letter of resignation. She had also recently had a run-in with a parent whose young son inexplicably died in post-operative care. In fact, there is an investigation into an abnormally large number of post-operative deaths at Denton General but as Frost learns, everyone who dies seems to have done so while occupying bed #5. DS Terence Reid is in hospital having been beaten in a public washroom. Frost is certain it has to do with his earlier investigation of Tim Hamilton, a university student from a well-off family who could be forcing shopkeepers to sell smuggled cigarettes. Given Reid's past, Supt. Mullett is prepared to write him off but Frost has every intention of clearing the man's name. DI Jack Frost investigates the disappearance of Tracy Uphill who vanished when her mother was late arriving at the community centre to collect her. He's also assigned DC Barnard, the Chief Constable's nephew, who receives a frosty reception from his fellow officers. In the course of searching for the girl, they uncover human remains that have been buried for 30 years or more. The remains are those of a bank clerk who had vanished with a large sum of money. When the assistant bank manager is murdered with the same gun used to kill the bank clerk, Frost must determine who else might have been implicated in the robbery. All during this time, Frost has to deal with his dying wife and an ever-increasing workload when his chief inspector falls ill. Autistic teenager Laurence Burrell is the only witness to an attack on a security guard at Denton's last remaining quarry and is hauled in by the police, later escaping back to the quarry, which he threatens to blow up. Frost is also kept busy when a woman claims that her ex-partner has abducted their young son, and Mr. Mullet is anxious that he investigate a series of burglaries which are strangely related. Frost investigates a robbery at a local casino and a hit and run accident that may involve Roger Massie, the son of a local Member of Parliament. Massie has previously been charged, but never convicted of reckless driving. Supt. Mullett is concerned that Frost is on a witch hunt but Frost soon realizes there is a connection between Massie and the casino, in the form of Massie's girlfriend, Julia King. Frost also receives a complaint about PC Shelby, who is accused of stealing jewelry but when Shelby turns up dead Frost must solve yet another complex puzzle. Frost's efforts to join a gym and date Julie, the fitness instructor, are hampered by two suspicious deaths. The first concerns a man found dead on a waste tip with no identity beyond an empty wallet, seemingly a mugging victim. However his wife comes to report his disappearance and Frost, in following through, is intrigued to learn that her sleep therapist is rather more than just the concerned friend he professes to be. Could these two meek little souls be capable of murder? The other body is that of escort girl Heather, found in a hotel room booked by married businessman Stephen Richman. He denies murder but confesses that he was shocked to realize what she did as she was a student friend of his daughter. Later he is found dead in his car but Frost can see no reason for his suicide and rightly so. The escort agency is involved in bringing in Eastern European girls to work as pole dancers and Heather's desire to join in the profits of the enterprise may just have caused her death. Frost eventually solves both cases and can at last relax with Julie. The Heal family is appalled to see the man whose lorry killed three of their members some years earlier is driving a bus. Because the lorry's mechanism was faulty he was acquitted of dangerous driving but the Heals are not happy and Andy Heal goes to the bus depot for a confrontation. Later the driver and his conductress are abducted from their bus. The conductress is diabetic and needs her insulin shots and, after a television appeal, she is dumped, alive, in town, not far from an alley where a clown is found dead. He recently entertained at a children's party where one of the mothers has a pathological phobia of clowns, and believes she attacked him without knowing. However, it turns out that he was also a thief, robbing the houses he visited and his killer may have been somebody else. In solving the death and finding the bus driver Frost's work is not helped by having to work with a female sergeant who had once reported him for being unprofessional. A body is found floating in the river, and the victim is not who he claimed to be. Further, the star player of a local soccer team collapses during a press conference following an incident on the field in which he received serious head injuries. DI Jack Frost investigates the stabbing of a woman during a robbery at a sub-post office. He is convinced that they have the culprits in custody but is frustrated by the limits placed on his ability to gather evidence. He also looks into an attack on the very pretty Helen Tudor who was pushed down the stairs at her university. She has no idea who may have pushed her but had recently rebuffed a professor, Dr. Michaelson, who had a reputation for getting too "close" to his students. In the course of the investigation, Frost learns that a woman very similar in appearance to Helen drowned some two years previously, even though she was a very good swimmer. Clive Barnard, now a DS in Boxborough, assists Frost in locating a possible suspect, a student who knew both girls. Frost finally finds himself a flat but also gets some unexpected lodgers. Frost is summoned to a remote farm-house by criminal Kevin Flanagan who is in a blind panic. At the farm he finds a crocodile and cages full of endangered species as well as a severed leg. This transpires to belong to an oriental man, part of the gang who have been smuggling rare animals, and Flanagan, who has escaped the gang, is used by Frost to help locate its leader. At the same time the Harris family are shocked to find the nude corpse of a local art teacher in their bedroom. A search of his studio yields revealing photos of a female colleague but it is the Harrises' teenage son, who, literally holds the key to events. Frost finds himself investigating the murder of Damien Law who was killed in his flat. Law was essentially a gigolo and a paid male escort who spent a great deal of time with a great many women. At least one client became obsessed with him and he also may have set himself up in competition with the long-time owner of an escort agency. Frost also determines that the case may be related to a recent suicide. Frost is also investigating a theft at the local cricket club. This time around, he is assisted by DS Prentice, a somewhat dour Scot. Presents keep arriving at Denton Police station from Frost's new secret admirer, though their identity turns out to be ironic, rather than adoring. He is up for promotion but Mullet seems to be more enthusiastic on his behalf and he even walks out of an interview panel because duty calls - a very sad duty, in fact. Bobby Palmer has gone missing whilst at a football match with his father, and there seems no doubt that the corpse discovered in a shed is his. The body of a second, malnourished boy, is also found dumped but this at least allows Frost to save a third lad from a grasping family. The fact that Anton Caldwell, a known paedophile, has been released from another area, and is living unsupervised in a local hostel fills him with rage, causing him to berate the psychiatrist who can only point out to him the failings of the system. Caldwell is not only a seedy little man but an extremely provocative one who taunts the police, saying that he 'loves' children and that it is quite all right for him to do so. Frost must restrain himself from allowing Caldwell to make him do something that will have an effect on his promotion. Cathy Thompson and her son, who has witnessed a murder, are being looked after in a safe house but it is not just negligence on the part of one of their protectors who goes to the shops which worries Frost. Somebody has located the Thompsons and, in Frost's book, this can only mean that there is a traitor within the police ranks. Cathy and her son go on the run, ending up in an aircraft museum where Frost has a showdown with the pursuer. Jack is in charge of the case of a three month old corpse found in the coal bin of an abandoned farm house. The body is eventually identified as that of a well known thief, but Jack has little to go on. DS Liz Maud has a case of a child abuser who is injecting children with water. Jack recalls a similar case and when they learn he is now in the area, have an immediate suspect. Jack feels sorry for him however and concludes that he can't be the person they're after. However, when two children are killed, both with indications of having injections, Jack may be in the soup. Supt. Mullett advises him that he will have no choice but to advise the Chief Constable and that it will likely lead to a disciplinary hearing. Fortunately for Jack, he sees a number of holes in Maud's case leading him to the the real killer. Frost and his men assist RSPCA officer Christine Moorhead in smashing an illegal dog fighting ring but its organizer, local gangster Gerry Berland, eludes them. One of Christine's helpers, Brian, is stabbed to death by Berland's thuggish son Sean, who believes he set the police on the ring,and Christine recognizes him and his accomplice,Neil. Berland arranges alibis for the boys and though initially appalled, his wife Sally colludes with him as he has always run her life. She persuades Neil's honest and horrified parents to go along with the lie. Having failed to warn Christine off, Berland sends a thug, Lisowski, to torch the RSPCA unit with Christine inside it with her rescued dogs. Meanwhile a mysterious criminal is duplicating unsolved crimes on Frost's books from years earlier and, as he goes to rescue Christine, Jack finds,chalked on his drive, 'You Die Next.' Christine survives her ordeal and grows closer to Jack, who meets her apparently friendly ex-husband. To silence Lisowski,a drug addict, Berland gives him an extra strong fix,which kills him. Frost realises the two men know each other but decides to bide his time. However,he has a piece of good fortune when Salmond, Berland's cocky solicitor, has his car stole by joy-riding colleagues and Salmond's large,personal stash of cocaine is found in the car.Frost levers him into revealing the location of the site where Berland trains his fighting dogs and from here on Berland's world collapses. Sean kills himself and Sally leaves him, watched by Neil's mother,who takes her boy to the police to confess everything. The copy cat criminal is revealed as the child of a bent copper exposed by Frost and seeking revenge. There is a stand-off atop a high building but Frost survives to marry Christine. There is, however, an uninvited wedding guest who may well cloud the happiness of the day. The naked bodies of three young men are found, arranged in a triangle, in a grave at an old burial site and an American anthropologist insists to Frost that these are ritual killings. However the fact that she has a book to promote and reports of unrest among local Eastern European immigrant workers suggest that the murders are not mystical at all. Ever the maverick, Frost enjoys crossing swords with James Callum, an unpleasant local business man who is going to tear down the local youth club to make way for new offices. When Callum's fitness instructress mistress, Rosemary, is found dead on her houseboat, and evidence also suggests that another of Callum's girlfriends died in suspicious circumstances some years earlier Frost cannot wait to pounce. First, however, he must get past Callum's adoring personal assistant, Michael. Perhaps a spot of breaking and entering would help Frost find the clues he is after. With Superintendent Mullett off work on a fortnight's leave, DI Frost is called on the carpet by the newly promoted Assistant Chief Constable for using unorthodox questioning techniques on suspected drug dealer Richie Dearne. Mullett calls Frost in when Ben Pecksmith has his Mercedes stolen at the local golf club. Turns out the thief travels from club to club, stealing cars as he goes along. Things take an interesting twist when the Mercedes is recovered the next day, with Dearne's body in the trunk. During Christmas, a local power station worker is burgled. Shortly afterward, he falls to his death in a mysterious accident. Then a young police detective, Tim Fox, is murdered. Frost wonders if Fox's death is really related to the large investigation he was working on to uncover a car theft gang. Frost continues to try to identify detective Tim Fox's killer. In addition, he tries to solve a series of pet shootings, for which he is eventually forced to seek help from a computer system run by a new junior WPC. His pursuit leads to a confrontation above a power station. Two young men are tricked by their girlfriends into stripping themselves nude for a midnight swim, during which the girls run off with the boys' clothes, leaving them to streak through Denton. One is arrested but the other, Roman Cassell, gets back to his office where,the next day ,he is found beaten to death. Suspicion falls on Jason Cohu and his father-in-law Joshua Ray, who blame Cassell for the death of Jason's wife and were in the vicinity of the office that night. Joshua admits to the murder but Frost believes he is innocent, misguidedly protecting his son-in-law and CCTV footage proves him right. At the same time Carl Meyer is released from a twenty year prison term. When he was a young boy he was accused of murdering a little girl with whom he used to play and with whose corpse he was found. Her cousin disappeared on the same day and he was also accused of killing her. The girls' family conduct a vendetta against him to which he shows no malice, claiming, as he had done all along, that he is innocent of both deaths. His only ally is the local vicar, whom Frost initially dismisses as a liberal 'do-gooder'. However she successfully convinces Frost that a simple lad like Carl would not be devious enough to maintain the same deception for so long unless he was indeed not guilty. This means that the real murderer is still at large. DI Frost welcomes a new member of the CID team, PC Ronnie Lonnegan. They soon are investigating a mysterious death when a body is found in the local water reservoir. There is no identification on the body and there doesn't seem to be a car parked nearby so they're not sure how he got there. The post-mortem indicates however that he didn't drown in the place where his body was found. They also investigate the death of Paul and Jean Harris who are killed when an an assailant ties them up and sets their house on fire. The main suspect is Mike Patterson, a handyman who had been doing work for the couple and who may have also been having an affair with Jean. Forensics indicate there is a connection between the death of the unknown man and the Harrises. Meanwhile, Supt. Mullett is his usual concerned self about a formal inspection of the station by a senior officer. Frost is also his usual self, which doesn't help matters. The police now have Mike Patterson in custody but he vehemently denies having anything to do with the death of the Harrises. DS Toolan thinks that Patterson is their man but Frost isn't so sure and believes the solution lies elsewhere. The dead man in the reservoir is identified as Reginald Molloy, a one-time resident of Denton. His mother returns to Denton to identify the body and hasn't a clue as to how or why her son would be there. They had moved away some 13 years ago after she witnessed a bank robbery and was required to give evidence in court. When Frost learns that Paul Harris' father was also a witness at the same trial he has the beginnings of the solution. Melanie Monkton, the daughter of the local gentry, is also missing and although under pressure to include her disappearance as part of the murder investigation, Frost thinks it's a completely separate case. Meanwhile, Frost's relationship with psychologist Pam Hartley seems to be going well though it does take an unexpected twist. A priest, Father Rose, is found covered in the blood of a murdered woman, the death bearing the hallmarks of a ritual killing, and Detective Sergeant 'Razor' Sharpe is drafted in to assist Frost, having investigated a similar death in his own area. The dead woman's family feel that her ex-boyfriend is to blame but Frost believes the priest is more involved than he is letting on. A glamorous profiler joins the team and suggests that they are dealing with a serial killer. And she is right. At the same time Frost feels responsible for the loyal George Toolan being hospitalized with severe injuries after falling from a high building whilst helping him prevent a suicide. Peter Lawson is a pawnbroker with a difficult family life. His father, retired after a long career in the army, is a demanding patriarch and his oldest children hate him. An armed robbery at his shop brings DI Jack Frost, now reunited with DS Clive Barnard, onto the case but all does sit well with the police. When Lawson is murdered a few days later, Frost and Barnard uncover a case of child abuse that has gone on for years. The ensuing investigation leads to a tragedy that will long affect the police and Jack in particular. At the Station, Supt. Mullett is being forced to cut his budget and has his eyes squarely set on making Jack redundant. An employee is shot dead during an armed robbery at a local family-run glass works business. One of the witnesses, the business owner, is threatened, and he goes into hiding. Frost must understand the family's tangled web of personal relationships in order to find who is doing the threatening. Meanwhile, Shirley Fisher's mother dies, and Frost does not attend the funeral. Also, DS Lawson mixes business and personal relationships, with serious consequences. Frost investigates the murder of a 15 year old girl who disappeared while completing her newspaper round. He also has to look into vandalism at a local churchyard as Supt. Mullett fears it might be the work of satanists but it is also where the 15 year old's body is found. He also has to deal with Mrs. Compton who has been receiving threatening phone calls. The Comptons are dealers of rare books and keep a large and valuable inventory in their home. When Mr. Compton is killed in a house fire, Frost quickly has a prime suspect. Finally, Frost receives a visit from his late wife's sister who now lives in America and doesn't seem to be in any hurry to return. Frost investigates the death of a young junkie, Ben Cornish. He is assisted by DC Costello, recently demoted after a punch up with a superior officer. The pathologist initially believes that Cornish choked on his own vomit but the autopsy reveals that he was beaten to death. Cornish had been in a good deal of trouble lately. He had stolen from his sister, he was harassing a local doctor and had been forcefully evicted while squatting in an abandoned house. A chance comment from a police constable gives Frost the vital information needed to bring the case to a close. Frost investigates two murders. The first is a homeless teenage girl, discovered beaten and drowned in Denton's river. The second is an environmental health officer, after a dismembered arm washes up on the shoreline. This discovery leads to the investigation of a local meat processing factory. Pauline Venables has been running a successful party/costume store in Denton with her sister Sue, but the siblings don't get on as well as they should. Their little world changes when Pauline brings home Karl Edwards, a divorced ex-con and announces he will be moving in after they are married. Sue resents him as an interloper interested only her sister's money. Sue's resentment can be traced back to an earlier incident when she found her then husband and Pauline in bed. Looking to make amends to her sister, Pauline decides to have Linda, a shop employee, take her to a deserted farmhouse to buy Sue a Labrador puppy for her birthday, something she's always wanted. Things go awry when Pauline's is brutally kidnapped by Linda's accomplice/lover, sociopath Graham McCardy, who binds Pauline and demands ï¿½30,000 in ransom... or else. It's a busy night for the Denton CID. Just as DI Jack Frost is about to leave on a fortnight's leave, the body of a young boy is found dead in an alley. He was found gagged and the pathologist determines he had been chloroformed and had choked on his own vomit. He had also had his left pinkie finger cut off. The police had initially thought the young boy was Bobby Kirby who had gone missing that evening, but they determine it's not the same child so they have both a murder victim and a missing child. The same evening, a couple returns home to find their front door open and their teenage daughter missing. The parents paid 25,000 pounds for her release but Frost has his doubts having had business with the girl's father in the past. As for Bobby, kidnappers demand a half million pounds from a major supermarket chain or the boy will be killed. The payment is made but the police operation is botched and they have to go back a few steps in order to get on the right track. Jack investigates an accident where Byrony Darrow was hit by a car while walking home. In a coma and unlikely to recover, Jack starts looking into her background. Her husband was at home with their daughter when the accident happened but there is evidence of sexual activity and Frost suspects that she may have been having an affair. What he learns about her shows that she had a far more complex life than anyone imagined. Separately, Jack investigates a robbery at a local brewery. Jack describes the robbery as "OTT" - over the top - since the thieves wore ski masks and used a sawed off shotgun when there was only one elderly security guard on duty. Using information from the police archives, he manages to lay a trap for the would-be thieves. DI Jack Frost investigates the murder of Nick Walder who was part of a group of saboteurs trying to disrupt the local hunt. DC Clive Barnard, the Chief Constable's nephew, is re-assigned to Denton CID. Suspicion falls on many, including the local hunt organizers and some of the saboteurs themselves as there was a schism within the group. A second saboteur, a local landscape gardener, is also murdered but when police uncover several barrels of antiques carefully packed and buried at the garden centre, the investigation takes a different turn. One of the hunt members, Stephen Milmore, owns an art gallery and also employs Ruth, the daughter of hunt organizer Alex Ormrod. Frost now needs to connect these events to identify the murderer. A sexual predator is on the loose in Denton. There have been a series of rapes and in all cases, he has broken into a home and waited for the victim to come home. The only exception is Emma Fox who, while driving home late one evening, finds that a man has hidden in the back seat of her car. The same evening, 17-year old Alison Cook has gone missing.A girlfriend thought she saw a man in an upstairs window but assumed it was her dad and thought nothing more of it. WPC Hazel Wallace is assigned to Frost and he decides to set a trap. Meanwhile, Frost is invited to a reunion in London for all Victoria and George Cross holders and the Chief Constable lets it be known that he expects Jack to attend. Only problem is that Jack has no idea where he's put his medal and can't find it. DI Jack Frost, along with Det. Sgt. Nash who has just transferred from London, investigates the murder of Vicky Phillips, a local physiotherapist who was stabbed to death in her car. Frost suspects one of her patients, Jonathan Meyerbridge, who has a criminal record but is now a born-again Christian. The local butcher, Mr. Sykes, is also acting strangely and denies knowing the dead woman even though she had keys to the vacant flat above his shop. Frost is also investigating a series of smash and grab robberies in the commercial district. The culprits drive a vehicle through the front window of a business and take anything they can within a minute or so before they scamper off. Just back from a holiday in Spain with his friend Kitty Rayford, DI Jack Frost investigates the death of Jeanette Barr, found on a nearby riverbank. The autopsy reveals that although she downed, it more likely happened in her bathtub and in the river. In the course of the investigation, Frost learns that she was having an affair with Richard Sheridan, a graphic designer who worked for her husband and his brother but he has an alibi for the time of her death. Jeanette's husband, Jack Barr, is known to Frost from when he investigated the murder of his first wife 10 years previously. Unfortunately someone is already serving a sentence for that killing and Jack finds himself suspended while an internal investigation takes place. DI Jack Frost is now living above an Indian curry restaurant and his day is off to an inauspicious start when he is held by a gun-toting teenager suspected of dealing in drugs. The police are concerned that there may be others guns being sold on the street. He also has to deal with another armed robbery of a security van and the death of a part-time soldier on maneuvers who was shot when everyone was supposed to be using blanks. Frost suspects the van robberies are an inside job. It's determined that the soldier could not have been shot with a military weapon and the police find an identical pistol to that used by the gun-toting teenager. Frost soon determines the motive and the identity of the killer. DI Jack Frost investigates a series of burglaries directed against old age pensioners. Things take a serious turn when an elderly woman is badly beaten. On examination however, this case doesn't fit the pattern of the others and may not be related. As well, the victim was very difficult and disliked by many, including neighbours and community volunteers. The case takes a nasty turn when another elderly victim is found dead, with the potential to create a panic among the public. Frost concludes that the second victim knew her attacker and proceeds to eliminate all possible suspects, one by one. Set against the brutal chaos of World War II, a love story begins that will take two lovers through a living nightmare of captivity, across three continents and two decades. From the steamy jungles of Malaya to the dusty and desolate outback of Australia Based on Nevil Shute' international bestselling novel A TOWN LIKE ALICE follows the lives of Jean Paget and Joe Harman. Meeting in Malaya--sh an attractive young English captive and he a cheerful Australian POW tortured for a simple act of kindness. Separated first by their captors then by the distance of passing years, the two are finally reunited in the rugged outback of Australia-to face a challenge every bit as demanding as their wartime trials.
null Have you ever wondered what it would be like to leave Earth? To lose sight of our home planet and go where no human has gone before? In 2010, blast-off with A Traveler's Guide to the Planets: a 6 x 50 minute documentary series exploring the pleasures and pitfalls of travel to the very alien planets of our own Solar System. What strange sights await you? What dangers must you avoid? A Traveler's Guide to the Planets visits the planets from two very personal perspectives: the direct experience of the people who have sent probes hurtling to all our cosmic neighbors now, and the viewpoint of any one of us who might dream of making a trip ourselves. Take a ringside seat to the splendors of the Solar System with A Traveler's Guide the Planets: an astronaut's guide to whole new worlds of possibility. Have you ever thought of blasting off to the King of the Planets? For a truly out of this world planetary experience, you should head beyond the Asteroid Belt to the largest planet in the solar system. Welcome to Jupiter, a world so roomy that it could swallow every planet and moon in the solar system and still have room for more. Yet for all its bulk there is nowhere to land, just an infernal drop into a bottomless sky. If you like solid ground beneath your feet, there's plenty of that as well. Encircled by some 63 moons and moonlets, Jupiter is like a miniature solar system all of its own. The four biggest moons offer off-world travel opportunities to die for. Rent by eruptions and bathed in intense radiation, Io is the most volcanic place in the Solar System, at once incredibly beautiful and astoundingly dangerous. But it is tiny, frozen neighbor Europa that everyone is trying to reach. Hidden beneath its icy crust is a vast alien ocean, warmed from within, and offering one of the best chances for an encounter with aliens that we have found beyond Earth. Mars is the ruby jewel in our night sky and arguably the hottest travel destination in the Solar System. Thanks to a robot invasion from Earth that began in the 1960's, we probably know more about Mars than every other destination in the Solar System combined. Not bad for a planet so cool that the average summer temperature makes a winter in Antarctica seem positively balmy. It might be freezing, there might be nothing for a human to breathe, but of all planets we know this rocky, red one is the most similar to home. Pack a good spacesuit and plenty of oxygen and prepare to be amazed. Here, under butterscotch skies, are vast rust-colored deserts and titanic canyons, towering volcanoes three times as high as Everest and mile-deep polar caps made of two different kinds of ice. This journey itself is a space traveler's dream: a short hop to the planet next door and a wealth of things to see and do. Here, on the fourth rock from the Sun, is our best chance to step into the rest of the Universe and the most likely place we know to encounter the alien life forms we might share it with. Got time for a 24 year vacation? Then consider a journey to our most distant planets, the ice giants Uranus and Neptune. There's only ever been one Earthly visitor to this ice zone, the Voyager mission, launched in 1977. What would it be like to follow in its wake, for a human to undertake one of the greatest journeys in space exploration? How would you get there? What would you see? And would you ever survive? Strap yourselves in for an incredible voyage to the outer Solar System. For more than 70 years Pluto was counted as the ninth planet, an isolated but sentimental favorite at the end of the Solar System. But in recent years this little world has been at the center of a neighborhood dispute of cosmic proportions. Just what on Earth caused Pluto to be struck off as a planet? It now seems Pluto has company, and lots of it. And we have more in common with this distant realm than you may have ever imagined. Take a trip to Saturn, the planetary pin-up boy, and not only do you get a ringside seat to the greatest spectacle in the solar system, but a close encounter with two extraordinary moons. Tiny Enceladus is making all the headlines as the must-see moon these days. It's the little moon that has it all: enormous geysers of water and ice shooting into space from the south pole point to a warm salty ocean beneath the surface and, perhaps, a real possibility of life. Even more earth-like and yet far more alien is Titan, with a thick atmosphere and weather. Potentially an easier surface to explore even than Mars, this is the only other world we know that you could visit without a spacesuit. Rug up for the cold and fly a hot air balloon in Titanian skies, trek across vast dune fields, or row across a Titanian lake. Just don't fall in or get caught in the rain: it's liquid natural gas out here, not water, and it'll freeze you as hard as rock. A Traveler's Guide to the Planets takes you on a tour into the Solar System's Hot Zone to visit the two planets both laying claim to the title of 'Real Hell'. While tiny Mercury blisters in the roasting glare of the Sun, cross over to the dark side and you'll find the temperature plummets over a thousand degrees. Back away from the Sun to cool off and we encounter Venus, our nearest neighbor. Smothered by a climate gone mad, a romantic visit to our sister planet's tortured scenery means diving into an atmosphere hot enough to melt lead, where acid smog eats bare metal for breakfast and the pressure could crush a submarine. What happened to turn our planetary neighbors so astonishingly alien? What can a visit tell us about our own? Penelope lives in the twentieth century, and it is only when she goes to live with her aunt at Thackers, a remote, ancient farmhouse, that she finds herself travelling back in time to join the lives of the Babington family, and watching helplessly as tragic events bring danger to her friends and the downfall of their heroine, Mary, Queen of Scots, whom they are seeking to rescue. The Johnsons live in a small country town. Their dairy farm has been in the family for three generations, and although in recent years they have been struggling, Mike - the father of David (13) and Katie (10) - is not about to let it go without a fight. David has his own worries - he is being bullied at school by Wayne Brogan (14), the son of a rich neighboring farmer. Wayne is particularly scornful of David's push-bike, which is no match for Wayne's own all-singing, all-dancing version. On the day our story begins, Wayne chases David home from school, knocking him into a ditch and badly damaging the bike. Mike is as suspicious of Pat Brogan as David is of his son: for some years now Pat has been offering to buy up the Johnsons' farm. The chief money-spinner of the farm is their specialist cheeses: with the bank threatening to foreclose, despite the best efforts of the family's accountant Larry Sharpe, there could not be a worse time for the persistent and mystifying spoiling of the product. Mike is not beyond believing Pat Brogan to be somehow behind the contamination - and Nicky (19), the Johnsons' attractive dairy assistant, doesn't like him very much either... The night of David's crash, there is a huge thunderstorm over the farm. David cowers under the sheets - and therefore misses the most spectacular effect of the lightning... ... Until he wakes the next morning - the morning of Friday the 13th - to find a girl in his room he has never seen before - insisting that he is trespassing in her room. Jem Johnson - from the year 2098. Jem's father, back in the future, has designed a "compucator" - what Jem calls a commie. The commie is an astonishing invention: a kind of hand-held, intuitive supercomputer, which works by accessing the user's alpha waves and the universal matrix, the 21st century's version of the Internet. Jem has the prototype, and was being chased by a couple of what she calls "badlanders" for it when she crawled into her closet to come out in David's time. Jem is charming, brave, quick witted - and impulsive. After a number of near-misses with David's bewildered family, and unable to get back to her own time, she finally takes matters into her own hands and introduces herself to Mary, the children's mother. Katie, David's sister, is very keen on Jem, particularly when Jem reveals a fantastic common skill of the future: telepathy, for which Katie displays a definite flair. Strangest of all, when Jem takes herself to school, she makes a surprising conquest - Wayne Brogan. The only thing that worries responsible David are the two sinister men who seem to take as keen an interest in Jem as Wayne does... David is suspicious of Wayne's sudden transformation into Sir Galahad, and slightly jealous as well. When Jem's commie goes missing from her locker, he suspects Wayne has stolen it, despite Wayne's indignant denial - and when Jem goes missing next, he's certain of it. He and Mike have an angry confrontation with Pat and Wayne, but at midnight Jem is still not back. Unable to sleep with worry, David is startled by the appearance of Katie in his bedroom. The telepathy game the children played has had an unexpected outcome: Katie is receiving persistent images she is sure are from Jem - images of an office, a filing cabinet, a night street seen through a window. The children slip out of the house with only their dog Bones for company and set off to the rescue; they are joined by an unexpected friend and ally - the erstwhile bully Wayne. Jem's images lead the children to the main street of their little town, and into the offices of ... Larry Sharpe. But what can the family's sympathetic accountant have to do with the kidnapping of Jem? As Katie and Bones keep watch outside, Wayne and David begin the difficult task of breaking into Larry's inner office, where Jem is bound and gagged. Katie is horrified by the appearance of Larry and - of all people - Nicky, the Johnsons' dairy hand: what on earth are these two doing together? Leaping to her feet, Katie cannons into the fire exit door through which the children broke in - and to her horror it slams shut, locking her out and the two boys in. There follows a tense scene with Wayne and David in precarious hiding - but eavesdropping can sometimes be illuminating: it becomes clear not only that Larry and Nicky are behind the kidnap and the theft of the commie, but that they have long been in collusion over the jeopardizing of the farm's produce - the "accidental" spoiling of the cheeses - in order to force a sale - and force the Johnsons out. With the appearance of the two men David has observed watching Jem, the dastardly quadrangle is complete. Larry pays off the kidnappers and he and Nicky leave, gloating. With not only the farm but the secrets of the commie in their grasp, they will be very rich villains indeed. Katie and Bones sneak into the building as David and Wayne free Jem. With her telepathic powers she unlocks the combination dial of the safe and regains her commie ... and David makes a very important discovery: documents that clearly implicate Larry in the fraudulent handling of the business affairs of the farm. The children's gleeful laughter merges with the rumble of an approaching thunder storm... ... and we open again on David asleep ... and his calendar, clearly showing Friday the 13th, as Mary shakes him awake. David stumbles downstairs, bewildered: Jem is nowhere to be seen, and his inquiry about her meets with a blank response from Mary. But Mike and Mary certainly have enough to be distracted by - the morning mail brings the precious contract from Pacific Dairy Products they have been waiting for, and the paper the shocking news of the arrests of Larry Sharpe and Nicky. David is lost in thought, as the joyous dance of his parents mirrors the joyous dance of he and Jem the night before ... and Katie enters, bearing a puzzling object: the commie, which she has just found in David's room. David can only smile at her: it is something he has dreamed up, dreamed up for the future... Laura Bradley and her two daughters Jenny (10) and Alison (13) are traveling in great excitement to their new home - the mysterious Bradley House, an unexpected inheritance from a great-uncle they never met. But their taxi driver, the surly Alfie Noakes, is rather less than welcoming: he tells them Bradley House is well-known in the neighborhood as haunted - and that nobody ever stays there long... Jenny loves Bradley House from the moment she sees it: she has a curious sense of being in her rightful home there. Alison just thinks it's spooky; Laura thinks the house is probably, and regrettably, going to be far too expensive to maintain. But Jenny wants desperately to stay, particularly when they uncover the full-length portrait in the Hall of Jonathan Bradley, circa 1780, a stern-faced captain of the Royal Navy. Great-great-great-great-Uncle Jonathan, who vanished in sinister circumstances two hundred years before: is he the famous ghost? Well, at any rate, he's family! But does Uncle Jonathan want the modern day Bradleys to stay? From the moment of their arrival strange and alarming events seem to be conspiring to force them out: shadows are half-glimpsed peering from windows, a flowerpot falls from the roof and comes dangerously close to felling Laura, footsteps are heard moving around in the dead of night... Jenny is not one to be thrown off the scent of a good mystery by a little fright. She is determined to track down the source of the footsteps, whether it be ghostly or mortal - and accordingly she creeps back into the house when Laura and Alison are in town, and discovers hiding in a locked room two stowaways - the cat Bartholomew and the brave and resourceful Tommy, a little boy of about her own age who has run away from the orphan's home he was placed in, and until the Bradleys' arrival had been roughing it in the empty house. Tommy is afraid that Jenny will tell Laura about him, and he will be sent back to the Home - but Jenny promises him she will not reveal his presence to anyone: he can go on hiding just as before. Laura, meanwhile, has been seeking advice on the possibility and wisdom of a sale from the apparently kind and decent solicitor James Pardoe - whose interest in the case seems to be partly motivated by his interest in Laura. Alison, too, is adjusting rapidly to the new town: on the steps of the library, waiting for Laura, she meets a new friend and fellow budding intellectual - Nigel Hargreaves (13). Laura comes home worried. Not only would the house be a monster to upgrade and maintain, but Pardoe feels that due to its reputation she is unlikely to make any money even from a sale - though he has managed to find an interested buyer for her, at a depressingly low price ... Laura's worry turns to outright horror as all three Bradleys are woken by terrifying noises in the night. Finally the chandelier crashes down right in front of where they are huddling together for safety, and Laura has had enough - she wants the girls to leave the house with her right now. But of course Jenny knows what the others do not - that Tommy is also here, and that if the place is really being haunted by a malevolent presence she cannot leave him behind. Despite Alison's protestations she dashes back into the house - and is captured by the man faking these so-called "hauntings": the Apparition turns out to be none other than their unfriendly taxi driver, the ruffian Alfie Noakes. But why is Noakes so keen on forcing the Bradleys to sell? With poor Tommy held as prisoner and hostage, Noakes gloatingly reveals all. In fact, the estate of Bradley House is worth a fortune - particularly if the house could be torn down to make room for a new development ... The unnamed buyer is Noakes himself - together with his partner, the deceptively sweet James Pardoe, Noakes is out to make a mint. But if Jenny wants to see her friend alive again, she'd better hold her tongue - and make sure Laura signs Pardoe's papers of sale tomorrow...Very subdued, Jenny rejoins her angry mother and sister. Reluctant as she is to leave Bradley House itself, furious as she is to have her family cheated out of its rightful inheritance in this way, it seems she has no choice but to go against all her own wishes and inclinations and try to persuade Laura to go with Pardoe's duplicitous suggestion. However, Alison has been suspicious of the lawyer from the start. With Nigel's help, she discovers the truth about the worth of Bradley House. Despite Jenny's tearful pleas to leave well enough alone, Alison and Nigel burst into the solicitor's office just as Laura is about to sign the papers - and spill the beans. Poor Mr. Pardoe, who had been driven to desperation by mounting debts, confesses all. But his contrition may have come too late for Jenny, who has raced back to Bradley House to save Tommy. Thwarted, Noakes turns nasty on both of them - especially when he receives a call from Pardoe telling him the game is over, he'd best give himself up. He seizes Jenny - she will be his hostage to freedom... At this desperate juncture, the real ghost of Bradley House enters - not Bartholomew, not Tommy, not Noakes, but Uncle Jonathan himself. "Unhand my niece, you knave!" - and Noakes flees for his life. So the immediate danger is averted. But there still remains the problem of how the Bradleys can afford to maintain their ancestral home. Nothing easier, Uncle Jonathan tells Jenny - and in one stroke their financial embarrassments and the two-hundred-year- old mystery of his disappearance are solved. Jonathan takes Jenny to a secret room that no one else has ever known of: and there sits Uncle Jonathan's skeleton, still in his naval uniform, still with its hand poised over the chest of gold coins he had been in the midst of counting at the moment of his death. David Morgan (12) is a natural scientist. He is already obsessed with what is destined to become his lifework: the design and construction of a time travel machine, what David affectionately refers to as the "Tasmo" - Time and Space Modulator. But the path of a boy genius in a small and conventional town can be thorny. David's father, Alan, would rather see him out on the playing field with a baseball than in the annals of history; to add insult to injury David is failing all his subjects except science, and even his teacher, the bookish spinster Miss Jameson, is beginning to lose faith that the Tasmo will ever work ... A mysterious newcomer to Alverton seems to know and understand more about David, his work and his problems than anyone else. What does the middle aged, balding and paunchy Donald Wells have to do with young David's life? When Alan's shop is broken into and the prototype Tasmo stolen, Donald seems the obvious suspect. But Donald Wells is from the future - he's been sent to ensure David does get the Tasmo back, because without it the development of time travel is impossible. He meets David "accidentally" in the park, and drops a clue as to the true identity of the thief that David can barely credit. In his groundbreaking work on the Tasmo, David has miscalculated more than the chronology determinator: dowdy Miss Jameson is not - or not simply - the altruistic mentor she seems. While essentially good-hearted, she has fallen desperately in love with the school headmaster, the cold and manipulative Eamonn Dodds, and at his urging has entered into a money-making scheme to get them out of Alverton forever - together. The Tasmo is a hair's-breadth away from actually working - and the plan is to steal it from David and sell it to the highest bidder. So David and Donald join forces. If Miss Jameson has stolen the Tasmo, then David must steal it back. He and Donald creep into the school in the dead of the night together - but the burglary goes badly wrong when David makes a shocking discovery: that Donald knows so much about him and his tensions with his father not because he was exceptionally well briefed, but because he is David - as David will be in 2035 ... This isn't the future as David imagined it - and if rescuing the Tasmo means that David will grow into the balding and overweight Donald, then it's time to change the course of history! David runs away, leaving Donald behind to be caught in the school grounds and arrested for breaking and entering - but not before he has hidden the Tasmo. Donald has had a pointed conversation or two with Alan, too - and when Alan realizes that David has abruptly lost all interest in time travel and turned overnight into a super-jock wannabe, he is more anxious than gratified. David refuses to discuss his change of heart, leaving his father very worried ... When he sees David being shepherded into the headmaster's car and driven away, his concern turns to fear. Dodds is of course frantic to find the Tasmo again - but his interrogation of David is of no use: David doesn't know where it is either, and at this stage, couldn't care less. Miss Jameson, who has been becoming more and more uneasy about the part she has played in the skulduggery, is shocked and disgusted by Dodds' bullying of who is, after all, her favorite pupil. Alan bursts in at the critical moment - and duplicitous Dodds draws a gun on all three of them. But Alan remains resolute under fire: he tells David he must do what he wants with his life, not what Alan or Dodds or Miss Jameson want ... Dodds sneers, but he would have done better to have kept alert: the moment she sees he is distracted, Miss Jameson creeps up behind her erstwhile suitor and knocks him unconscious with a vase. As Dodds falls, the vase shatters - and there in the shards lies the Tasmo, David's historic invention - and his future. In 1928, Bertie Milton won the Godolphin Cup on a horse trained by his grandfather, Sir Jasper - the only amateur jockey ever to win the race. The victory was celebrated at the famous annual Milton House Fancy Dress Ball: but the consequences of this particular party could not have been foreseen by anyone... A tragic accident leaves Bertie a reluctant ghost - a ghost who can't bring himself to scare the living, and one who has yet to master the simplest skills of the afterlife - dematerialization, for instance, or how to walk through walls. Unfortunately for Bertie, his haunting is being overseen and critiqued by a very tough taskmaster: Mr. Pym, the ultimate spectral bureaucrat. And Bertie has been assigned a most specific task: no one who is not part of the Milton family must be allowed to stay in the rambling old Milton Hall - which, since the Milton line has entirely died out, is kind of a tall order... ... And does not bode well, in 1998, for the Rhodes family - David, Paula, and their two children, Kate and John. David is a writer; he and his agent, the excitable Hugh, are in the final stages of negotiation of the sale of the screen rights to his latest novel. Perhaps rather precipitately, David has bought the Milton mansion against the vast profits he and Hugh confidently expect to flow in when the deal goes through ... But will it? Paula has some doubts, but Kate and John don't care. They fall in love with Milton Hall on sight; and the resident ghost becomes equally rapidly fond of them. It turns out that David has a connection to the place even Paula was unaware of: when a young woman his grandmother worked as a servant there, and told David so many exciting and colorful stories of the house that as a child he used to dream about it. For David, coming to Milton Hall for the first time has an eerie sense of coming home. He hangs a portrait of his grandmother in the main hall and settles down to prepare for his final meeting with the film company. Al Wicks, the fast-talking and very overbearing American producer interested in the project, comes to dinner: but due largely to Bertie's playful antics leaves in a fury, telling David he has just blown the best deal he'll ever see. David is himself so angry at the changes Al was intending to make to his precious story he hardly cares: but how will the Rhodes family stay in Milton Hall without the sale of the book? Several money-making schemes are cooked up between Bertie and the children, but all are foiled by Mr. Pym and an unexpected ally. Driven to distraction by his charge's hapless good humor, Mr. Pym has summoned the man who brought Bertie up: if anyone can bring the undisciplined spook into line, it is his authoritarian grandfather, Sir Jasper. But alas for Mr. Pym - Sir Jasper has secrets of his own. He is startled to find hanging in his old home the portrait of David's grandmother - a young woman he was once very much in love with. In the second chance of the century, Sir Jasper and David's grandmother meet again - and the best marriages are made in heaven... So the Rhodes family becomes part of the Miltons, and are permitted to stay. Sir Jasper now throws his redoubtable energies into securing their fortune: he and his ghostly bride choose to take their honeymoon in the Malibu mansion of Al Wicks, and prove very persuasive. Al relents; David's deal is made; and the family settles into what, in a strange twist of fate, has become their ancestral home. Jamie Irving (12) loves and admires his father - but the two of them are worlds apart. Rick - tough, smart, perfectionist, and very determined - has a glamorous and dangerous job as an investigator working for Customs; he is the quintessential man of action, and does not understand how to deal with his gentle, intellectual son. Jamie feels misunderstood and constantly put down by Rick; when he cannot handle effectively the bullying a timid boy of his age is often subjected to, he feels his father despises him. But Rick is about to find out that there are times when discretion is certainly the better part of valor. He has stumbled onto information that he may have to pay for with his life. The smooth and debonair Alex Trent - a big time businessman, with powerful government contacts - is dealing in nuclear arms: the next shipment is due at any moment. It is a case with frightening international ramifications, and the last person Rick should have chosen to confide in is his boss... For Marsh is working for Trent himself - and Rick is taken hostage, interrogated, and then thrown into the harbor, more dead than alive. It seems incredible to Jamie that his larger-than-life father could be vulnerable in any way - but an even bigger shock is in store for him... For Rick appears to him as he plays in the garden, and tells Jamie he desperately needs his help. But how can this be, when Rick is lying comatose in Intensive Care? - Rick's spirit has "dissociated" from his body, and Jamie is the only one who can see him. It may be the first time Jamie has had his father's undivided attention in his life... Rick and Jamie's first attempts to alert the police to what has really happened to Rick, and what he risked his life to defeat, are foiled at every turn. Rick knows he will need hard evidence to convince anyone of what seems an outrageously far-fetched scenario - that a highly respected businessman and a senior inspector are working together to supply arms to terrorists. During his interrogation he had noticed surveillance cameras all through Trent's hideaway, recording the every move of its inhabitants. Perhaps his own security measures could be turned against the villainous Trent - if Rick and Jamie could only get the tape showing Trent giving the order to have Rick killed to the police ... But between Rick's impatience and Jamie's timidity, none of their carefully-laid plans come to fruition. The turncoat Marsh - who is still presenting the plausible face of the caring boss to the world - is, like Jamie's mother Jean, puzzled by Jamie's peculiar behavior, and the "fantasies" he is having about what happened to his father ... But unlike Jean, Marsh knows how close these so-called fantasies come to the truth. And time is running out... Rick for the first time understands he will not be able to achieve his object without figuring out a way to work as a team with his son. Both sets of unique and specialized skills - Jamie's quick mind and technical expertise; Rick's strength, decisiveness and courage - must play a part if their plan is to succeed. Jamie - guided and directed by Rick - manages to infiltrate Trent's center of operations and acquire the incriminating tape. He is immediately pursued - but Rick cannot stay with him: his time is up - if his spirit does not go return to his body he will probably die. Jamie bravely insists his father leave him to fight the rest of the battle alone. In demanding respect for his own strengths, Jamie discovers he is braver and more resourceful than he knew - and in that, he is truly his father's son. Louise Adams (14) is new to Cranford - and she doesn't like it. Cranford is a place where people either fit in or move on, and Louise knows which of her options she'd prefer. She and her mother Kath have moved to this old mining town after the disastrous break-up of the Adams' marriage. Despite her very good relationship with Kath, Louise is so bitter about the circumstances of the divorce, and in particular her father's new partner, that she is determined not to make any effort in her new school or her new life - in short, not to trust anyone, ever again. Her only consolations are running - at which she excels - and her loyal setter, Minty. Louise's talent at track has been noticed - both by the crusty but lovable coach, Mike Horan (late '60s), and Anna and Pat, two girls from Cranford High who first meet Louise at the Yacht Club with her father and are anxious to be friends. However, Louise rebuffs approaches from both parties - she won't join the track team and she'd rather not socialize at all, thanks. Lou's high-school teacher, Mrs. Yates, is beginning to be concerned about her: she feels that perhaps it is time for Louise to have some counseling. Kath is alarmed by the suggestion, and Lou rejects it out of hand: all she wants is to be left alone. As far as she is concerned, her running is therapy enough. Louise's favorite place to run is by the now-defunct mine, along the tracks that wind up through the wooded mountain. The only people in the town who take an active interest in the mine are Mike Horan, who still pans for the tiny flecks of gold there are left, and the mysterious Charlie (17): a pale, withdrawn boy who wears the Cranford High tracksuit, but is never seen in school. Louise has seen Charlie in the distance on several of her runs, but whenever she rounds a corner after him it's as if he's vanished into thin air. Louise's class is working on a project researching Cranford and its history. Mrs. Yates tries to encourage Louise to join in with a group, but she insists on working by herself - and for good measure rejects another invitation from Anna to come with the other kids to the local hangout after school. Instead Lou goes to the library alone to begin research on the mines ... and looks up to find Charlie watching her silently from across the stacks - but before she can approach him, he has gone. Louise is becoming genuinely interested in the history of the mines. On her next run she takes her camera with her to get some photographs for the project. To her annoyance, Charlie runs into frame just as the shutter descends. It's not a propitious first meeting: he's no more happy about having his photo taken than she is about having her shot of the deserted shaft ruined. To add insult to injury, Charlie tries to persuade Louise to stay away from the mines in future - out of danger. The fiercely independent Lou is infuriated. But it seems she need not have worried about Charlie spoiling her photo. To her bewilderment, none of the prints show his image at all, and no one at the small school seems to know whom she's talking about when she describes him. Mrs. Yates has a suggestion to further her work, however - to check the Cranford Gazette "Morgue", or archives, to see what old material might be held about the mines. Louise finds none other than Mike Horan running the Morgue. In Mike she recognizes a kindred spirit, despite her stubborn refusal to join his precious track squad. Mike too is a little uneasy about Lou continuing to run so close to the pits; when she describes the boy who warned her off, he listens closely - then finds her a photograph of Charlie dated ... 1961. But how can a photograph of the adolescent boy she met be thirty-six years old? Why does her presence on the mountain make him so nervous, and what does any of it have to do with Mike Horan? Louise's next encounter with Charlie is dramatic. In her wish to be totally self-sufficient, she has paid too little attention to warnings about the danger of the mine: we open on her frozen with fear at the lip of the Cranford Pit, beyond the "DANGER" signals and the protecting fences. Charlie approaches silently from behind her - there is a frightening moment when it seems he might be about to push Louise to her death; instead, he seizes her wrist and pulls her clear just as the edge of the shaft caves in. It's certainly a hell of an ice-breaker, and quite soon - to the evident pleasure of both of them - the two are chatting like old friends. Charlie shares Lou's interest in the workings of the old mine, and between that, their shared "loner" status and their joint excellence at running, they are well on the way to feeling they are soul mates. Neither Kath nor, at first, Minty share Louise's pleasure in her newfound friendship with Charlie. The loyal dog is curiously uneasy in the boy's presence; Kath just can't understand why Lou won't bring him home to meet her, and - herself still hurting from her recent divorce - she's suspicious of Charlie's motives. Louise is indignant - isn't making friends exactly what Kath has been bothering her to do? She feels comfortable with Charlie in a way she hasn't felt with anyone in a very long time: she feels she can trust him, that she can confide in him, and that he does not judge her. Apart from Mike, Charlie is the only person she tells about her sense of Len's betrayal. Charlie is empathic - the loss (even the perceived loss) of a father is very difficult and lonely; he knows, he lost his own... Back at school, Louise participates no more than she did before, and is being singled out by the school bully, Brenda, and a couple of her nasty cronies. They're scornful of her stories of Charlie - oh right, the invisible boyfriend, the one in the photograph who wasn't there? Louise tells herself she doesn't care - she spends more and more time with Charlie, who even Minty has grown friendly toward. They run and hike and fish together, but to Louise's disappointment, Charlie always refuses to come down into the town with her and meet Kath, or go to one of the school socials. Clearly the situation cannot continue as it is forever, and the crisis comes when Brenda spies on Louise and Charlie - and discovers Louise apparently talking to herself. Brenda tells Anna and Pat that Lou's crazy, talking to trees - and the adults' concern about Louise and this mysterious boyfriend comes to a head. Lou's furious - she feels invaded and misunderstood: she goes to Mike for comfort, and he shows her an astonishing thing: black-and-white footage of the disaster that finally closed the struggling mine. Three men were trapped below: we see, stepping forward to volunteer - Charlie. The photographs, the footage, the fact that no one else seems ever to have seen Charlie - Louise is totally bewildered. Mike sends her to ask Charlie about it himself. Finally Charlie explains. His father's death in Korea, forty years before, and his mother's following soon thereafter left him feeling bitter and hopeless: he volunteered for the rescue mission because he didn't care what happened to him any more. And rescue he did - Mike Horan, who was partly crippled in the accident, but escaped with his life: and in this, he was luckier than Charlie. Louise cries as Charlie tells her that she must never allow herself to feel hopeless or bitter: what she has is not a rehearsal, it is the real thing - her only life. She must forgive her father and be brave enough to trust other people again ... and she must do one more thing for him, Charlie, to allow him to finally rest in peace. Mike Horan has become almost frantic with worry as Louise has still not come home. From his point of view, we find her standing at the edge of the pit - is she about to throw herself in? But then Louise drops into the void a bunch of yellow roses ... She looks round to find Mike smiling at her. This was her last gift to Charlie: the grief at his untimely death of someone who loved him. They return home to find Kath in a state of great excitement. This boyfriend of Louise's has gone right over the top: her room is filled to bursting with - yellow roses. Groby Temporal, clock-maker, bon vivant and black wizard, has lived alone on his own private beach for longer than anyone can remember. He claims the land was given to his father in perpetuity - but the local town council can prove otherwise. They are determined to erect budget holiday chalets for city families on just a hundred yards of the land Groby is accustomed to calling his own. Twenty adults and perhaps sixty children staying within spitting distance?! - It is at this point that the councilors start mysteriously disappearing, one by one ... Three penniless orphans - Murray (12), Ruth (12) and Dot (10) - are the only children from the Home left unclaimed for the holiday period. Wandering disconsolately in the woods, they discover and rescue a dog caught in a rabbit snare. In return, Vespa leads them to her home, the magical house of Miss Angela Dwelf, charming and eccentric white witch. Angela has been called in by the authorities to control Groby Temporal, who has sent one citizen too many into limbo - into what Groby himself calls "darkness visible". The feud between the two sorcerers' families is of generations' standing - ever since Angela's great-grandfather convicted Groby's father of black magic, and sentenced him to hang ... But what is it in the children that Groby instantly recognizes? What power do they possess that he fears - Groby Temporal, who fears nothing? Angela is intrigued. Is it that they are three children together, or orphans, or - as Angela suggests - simply that they are so young they have time on their side - a sensitive issue for an erstwhile clockmaker who's overstayed his welcome by more than a century? Not one to pass up a possible advantage, Angela takes the kids with her when she goes to confront Groby. With him distracted, she sends the kids into Groby's shack to discover the secret weapon she can sense, and from which he derives his power. But Groby catches them in the act - and although Murray and Ruth escape, little Dot is kidnapped and held hostage. Groby tells Angela that unless she persuades the councilors that the beach rightfully belongs to him, none of them will ever see Dot again ... Time for a rescue! By dint of stone-throwing, window-breaking and slingshot-wielding, Ruth and Murray manage to get Dot out of the shack safe and sound ... But Groby switches his attention to Murray himself - and sends him into "darkness visible". He swears Murray is lost to them forever - and he and Angela engage in a shape-changing battle to the death on the sands. Angela opens strongly, but without the knowledge of Groby's secret weapon she is slowly beaten down. Ruth and Dot, watching in anguish from further up the beach, realize that to save not just Murray's life, but the whole town, they must identify and dismantle the source of Groby's strength. Ruth tears into the shack. As she looks around desperately, the four clocks that stand guard in each corner of the room begin to chime in perfect discord: Angela's time is up. Ruth realizes that the clocks are set at different times - what better metaphor for a clockmaker gone horribly to the bad? Frantically she resets the clocks so that they are chiming together harmoniously - and in the same way that Angela is weakened by dissension, Groby Temporal is by accord. He falls powerless to his knees - to be banished forever by Angela. The time of Temporal is over. The beach once more belongs to everyone. And the three orphans have found with Angela Dwelf a home worth fighting for: they are orphans no longer. Being thirteen is difficult enough at the best of times - and Jessica is not having the best of times. Her mother, Rose, has recently become bedridden with a mysterious illness. Despite a battery of tests, none of the doctors know what Rose is suffering from, and when, or indeed if, she will get better. In this time of great stress for the family, Jessica's relationship with her stepfather Mike has deteriorated sharply. The only pleasant thing in Jessica's life is her new friendship with the boy who is working on the farm for the summer, the level-headed and practical Chris (16). Chris is an invaluable ally and confidant - for Jessica is beginning to believe that Mike actually hates her... In this frame of mind, Jessica is vulnerable to a very eerie experience. In town to buy the week's groceries, she stumbles across a little bookshop she has never noticed before. The bookseller who runs it - an elderly, sprightly man, with a faintly malevolent smile - selects a book especially for her: Jessica is even embossed on the cover. But how does the bookseller know her name? When Jessica brings the book home she finds, to her astonishment, that it is the diary of a girl called Jessica Brown, exactly her age, writing exactly a hundred years before. The diary makes extraordinary reading - for the coincidences between the lives of the two girls do not stop there. Most striking of all is the relationship between the long-dead girl and her stepfather - who Jessica Brown detested... It becomes clear, in fact, that Jessica Brown believed her stepfather was planning to kill both her and her mother in order to inherit the farm. And the story is unfinished: it stops abruptly on January 13th. Was Jessica Brown murdered, as she feared she would be? Chris and Jessica search out the church records for more information. They find the record of Jessica Brown's birth, and her grave, but no date. Could this old tragedy possibly have any bearing on what is happening to Rose? Could it be that Jessica Brown is somehow trying to warn the present-day Jessica of a terrible danger? The diary begins to have a sinister sway over Jessica's mind. As the 13th of January comes closer in the present day, Jessica becomes convinced that the diary was sent to her as a warning... Chris has observed the development of Jessica's obsession with increasing concern. He steals the diary, hoping that simply removing its presence might help Jessica. But the diary simply reappears in Jessica's room - it seems neither of the children are able to destroy it until its task is done. The thirteenth dawns with Jessica actually sick with apprehension. She is now certain that Mike has been slowly poisoning Rose, and that he will kill her, Jessica, too - if she doesn't take drastic action ... The poison she finds in the doctor's bag when he pays a house visit seems a gift straight from heaven. Now completely under the diary's evil influence, Jessica steals the poison - and pours it into the bowl of soup she has been preparing Mike. Chris arrives in a terrible panic. In continuing his investigations he has had a great stroke of luck: he has stumbled across the name of Jessica Brown in an old newspaper. But the story the article tells is not what Jessica has been led to believe. Far from Jessica Brown dying at thirteen, she lived to be an old woman - in an asylum. She was notorious in the district at the time for the murder of her stepfather - who she believed to be trying to murder her ... History is indeed about to repeat itself, and in the most hideous way. When the two children rush into the kitchen Mike is just polishing off the last of the soup ... but that's not the bowl Jessica gave him! They realize Mike has taken the poisoned bowl upstairs - to Rose... In the nick of time Jessica races into her mother's room and spills the poisoned soup all over the bed. As the replay of the hundred-year-old tragedy is thwarted, the diary disappears from Jessica's room as if it had never been there. On the same fateful day, Rose's illness is at last diagnosed - she can be easily treated. Jessica is at peace - and finally, she comes to believe, so is poor Jessica Brown. "...The two enduring English folk-heroes are Robin Hood of Sherwood Forest and King Arthur of Camelot. We know Sherwood Forest existed - it's still there. But where was Camelot? ... A hundred years ago three brilliant men were prepared to risk their sanity - and their lives - to prove they knew its exact location ... " Our story opens in Victorian England. Vicky (14) and Aidan (11) Tudor are wildly excited about the imminent return of their mother and father after three years traveling abroad. However, the carriage that finally rumbles up the driveway contains not their parents but their beloved uncle, the gentle and scholarly Lance Dulac (36). The Tudors' ship has been delayed, and in their absence Lance has come to take the children with him to visit his dear friend, Arthur LeRoy, the Earl of Sackville, and - perhaps even dearer to Lance - the Earl's lovely and lively daughter Guinevere (18), known to all simply as Jenny. To Aidan's particular delight, the Sackville's estate, Gramayre, is in Dorset, deep in Cameliard: the land of King Arthur and his court of Camelot. But despite the warm welcome the children receive from the Sackvilles, this is far from being a simple holiday in the countryside. Even as they approach Gramarye for the first time, a mysterious wind blows up around them: harsh, hot and dry, a terrifying roar filled with menace. Strangest of all, although the sound of the wind is deafening, it seems to move nothing in its path. As the children react in fright, we see their carriage is being watched through narrowed eyes by the sinister gypsy Morgana. Jenny is particularly pleased to make the children's acquaintance, and it doesn't take long for quick-witted Vicky to notice that Jenny and her uncle have a certain understanding between them. However, Lance's primary purpose in coming to Gramarye is the pursuit of knowledge rather than love: he, the Earl and a third party, the sombre Merlyn Tredinnick, have been working on an excavation site within the estate for fifteen years, and their work is nearing completion. Arthur, Lancelot, Merlin and the lady Guinevere drawn together again: Aidan is delighted by the coincidence, but as Jenny points out, if he remembers the legend correctly, it is not necessarily a happy one ... To the children's disappointment, their first day at Gramarye dawns gloomily. Confined indoors, they decide to explore the house - and very rapidly make an intriguing discovery: a shrine concealed behind an ornate mirror, and within it, a sword and anvil beneath a medieval tapestry. The face of the knight figured there is startlingly like that of their host, the current Lord Sackville. But when the children tell Jenny of their discovery she is half-uneasy, half-indifferent. Jenny, indeed, is the only adult in the household not in the thrall of the Arthurian legend, and perhaps she has good reason. Lance has formally proposed to her, but they cannot marry until the work on the excavation site is complete. As Jenny tells the children, if you become too obsessed with the past it leaves no time for the present: and the present is where we live. The second day dawns fine, and with the men busy at the site, Jenny, Vicky and Aidan set out for a picnic on the lake. Aidan, who true to form is paddling his own canoe, is ahead and out of sight of the others when he finds himself being dragged off-course. He is horrified to see guiding the wayward canoe a woman's arm, clothed in white, rising from the waters of the lake. Leaping ashore in terror, Aidan sees a figure in white beckoning him on ... and as if hypnotized, he sets out to follow her... The modern day king, knight and necromancer have uncovered an astonishing find: a Roman tessellation, perfectly preserved: and in the center, the figure of a medieval monarch - King Arthur. As Professor Dulac gravely observes, this is potentially the most dangerous archaeological discovery ever made - because it utterly defies both time and history. Echoing the Obsession in August cont. knight in the children's tapestry, the face of the King is ... that of the Victorian Arthur LeRoy. Into this solemn conclave comes Aidan, hot, dusty, frightened, and whooping for breath. The Earl wheels on him in fury - the nature of their work has always been contained in complete secrecy. Sobbing and distressed, still under the partial thrall of a magic he does not understand, Aidan bolts away through the forest, with a mysterious voice singing threateningly in his head: the King needs him, the King needs him... Jenny and Vicky are not the only ones relieved when Aidan stumbles upon their picnic site. There is a nasty consequence for Aidan of his afternoon's adventure, however - he has run through hemlock, and the pollen has burned him badly: Vicky finds him in the bedroom very ill indeed. Jenny is reassuring - she has seen hemlock burn before: the old gypsy Morgana will be able to mix a potion to counter the poison. Vicky approaches Morgana's caravan in great fear and trembling, and certainly the wise woman's reception of her is chilling. She sends Vicky running with both the antidote and a flea in her ear. Stumbling round the side of the caravan, Vicky sees, to her horror, a crude small gallows from which three clay figures dangle ... Standing behind her, whispering in her ear, Morgana coaxes the girl to study the faces of the figures: and as Vicky watches they mix into those of Sackville, Dulac and Tredinnick - Arthur, Lancelot and Merlin. These three are meddling in a past that does not belong to them - and no good will come of it. The following day Aidan is better, but still not well enough to venture out of doors. The girls go off on a sketching expedition and leave him to his own devices. Bored and disgruntled, he returns to the hidden shrine - but discovers that the sword and anvil have vanished. How can this be? Then, terrifyingly, the face of the King in the tapestry speaks to him: he must not tamper with Camelot; it will destroy him if he disobeys. Aidan bolts, badly frightened. His dreams that night are full of menace and foreboding, but the children are powerless to dissuade the three men from setting out on the final day of the dig. Indeed, all three are hugely excited: they have uncovered, beyond the tessellation, what appears to be a granite tombstone - and in its side, engraved in Latin, are the words, "The once and future King." Could it be that the Holy Grail lies buried inside? Cindy (13) and Jonathan (10) Copeland live happily in a small seaside village with their fisherman father, Bob. Since the mysterious disappearance of their mother when Jonathan was still a baby, they have been cared for by their gruff but kind Aunt Moya. The only cloud on the horizon is the recent downturn of business: with the waters around the port close to being fished out, Bob is having a hard time earning a living. All that looks set to change one day when he brings in a very special catch - the merman... Aunt Moya is horrified when Bob has the merman preserved and brings his trophy home - mer-people are said to be very bad luck, and haven't the Copelands had enough of that? But the children are fascinated - especially Jonathan, who has a keen interest in all natural things, and trails a constant menagerie of pets in his wake wherever he goes. The superstitious village people, like Moya, are shocked and disapproving, but the outside world takes a keen interest in Bob's find. All the media attention gives Bob an idea: with fishing no longer a going concern, why not turn his hand to the hotel business? And so the Copelands' home is transformed into a seaside inn - The Mermaid's Rest. Business booms, and at first it seems the merman has brought the family nothing but good fortune. But there are some unpleasant surprises looming. Aunt Moya's husband Jim has a nasty accident: she and the children are already overworked running the inn, and now that she must look after Jim, Bob is at his wits' end. This is when Moya has her brilliant idea. It is high time Bob stopped grieving for Mary, the children's mother, and found him a new wife. What better way to vet candidates than by - advertising? Jonathan is vastly amused by the responses to Bob's ad, but Cindy is not at all - the village is laughing at them, and anyway, she doesn't want a stepmother: she thinks the family is complete as it is. Her worst fears are realized by the arrival of the first prospect, the cold and manipulative Jennifer Shilling. Greatly distressed, Cindy runs out of the house - heading for the hills, where she can be alone and mull things over... But what Cindy stumbles across is the little hut of the Anchoress - the Holy Woman of the Blari Hills. Drawn by this woman, Cindy pours out her troubles. In return, the Anchoress tells her a story which seems oddly familiar - of a beautiful young woman, a stranger, who came to the village, fell in love, married, had children - and then vanished. That night Cindy can't sleep: the sound of the sea seems to be calling her. From her window she looks down on the beach, and sees a still figure, a woman, standing before the waves - and then another appears: it is her father. As Cindy watches he runs after the woman, calling for her to come back ... but when Cindy arrives on the beach, both of them are gone; and in the morning, when she asks him about it, Bob doesn't know what she's talking about. Cindy tells Jonathan about the Anchoress, and takes him up to where she first came across the hut. But all that remains is a small shrine, with a plaque dated ... 1776. Cindy is bewildered, the more so as she continues to catch glimpses of who looks like the Anchoress in the village - entering the church, in the old village shop - but by the time she reaches her, the mysterious woman has gone. Meanwhile, Bob's search for the perfect wife continues just as fruitlessly as before. Jan Pollock has the advantage of great good temper - and an appetite to match, which when Jonathan's rabbit Fizz disappears leads Jonathan to fear that Jan has eaten him. The children scour the hills for the wandering bunny - and once more find the Anchoress' hut. But this time the story she tells is slightly different: it is of a man who falls in love with a mermaid he once glimpsed in the waves, and searches for her ever afterward, lost without his one true love. For the first time Cindy realizes what it must be like for Bob to live alone, even if he does have her and Jonathan for company; and she makes a fateful wish: that Bob might, after all, find love and marry again. Not that the third candidate, Hazel Bouncer, is what Cindy has in mind. Hazel has a compulsion to organize and reorganize: the house is in an uproar for the duration of her stay, but her visit has an unexpected outcome. Amongst the drawers Hazel turns out is a photograph - the only one of her mother that Cindy remembers ever seeing - and who Mary looks like ... is the Anchoress. Bob too is tiring of the search; he begins to believe with Moya that perhaps the merman, floating inscrutably in his bell jar, has brought them bad luck. The children set off on a picnic - secretly they are going once more in search of the Anchoress: Cindy means to ask her for a miracle - for Bob to find a wife he can love. While they are gone, Bob impulsively takes the merman in its jar and sets out to bury the creature at sea. But while he is gone a terrible storm blows up, and Bob is believed lost. The children, however, never lose hope. Bob has been missing a week when Jonathan, combing the beach for clues as to the fate of the Mary Jean, comes across a seaweed pouch - filled to bursting with tiny, pearly shells: with mermaid coins. Back at home Moya has opened the last letter in response to Bob's advertisement: from a young woman named ... Maris. When Jonathan comes racing home with his treasure Moya bursts into tears - the mer-people cannot pay for Bob's life with this! Cindy, however, has quite a different understanding of the gift from the sea: a dowry - for a mermaid princess! For Maris! And she insists Moya answer the letter, asking Maris to come immediately. When Maris' letter of acceptance arrives Cindy races down to the quay - with the bride on the way, can the bridegroom be far away? And there indeed is the Mary Jean, coming finally and safely into port, with Bob and a huge catch of fish aboard. When Maris arrives it is as if the entire family recognizes her: green-eyed and gentle, she is the Anchoress, or she is Mary, or she is some magical combination of both. The tide has turned; the mermaid is indeed finally at rest. Beneath the spreading shade of an ancient, solitary oak, two young men, Tobias Jones and Samuel Crittenden, melt into our vision. They are dressed in late eighteenth-century costume - breeches and shirts - and face each other aggressively, swords in hand. From some distance we hear a woman crying their names - the beautiful Ariadne Blake, running desperately to where the rivals stand. As if her voice was the catalyst the men needed, they begin to duel... Two hundred years ago Tobias and Samuel both lost their lives in a bid to win the hand of Ariadne - who loved neither. Now, once a year, on the anniversary of the tragedy, the ritual of hate is played out again, and the fruitless battle waged with Ariadne once more helpless to avert it. Always before the duel has been unobserved; but this year things are about to change... ... Ben Garfield (13) has only one thing in common with the school bully, Darren: their mutual interest in the pretty and feisty Zoï¿½ (also 13). The children are being taken on a training run by their coach and mentor Chris Hayward when Darren trips Ben up - and the class runs on, leaving him behind. Winded and breathless, Ben literally does not believe the evidence of his own eyes when the ghosts fade into being before him. The ghosts have always been bound to the site of the oak tree itself, but when they are seen, for the very first time, by a living person, they find that they are able to leave it. Samuel has an idea: if they could possess real bodies once more, they could settle the feud once and for all. Ariadne is alarmed by the implications, but Samuel and Tobias don't wait around to listen to her objections - they melt into the air in hot pursuit of Ben. Tobias makes the first move - and finds that he can indeed infiltrate another human being, though it's tough work. (Ben - bewildered by the momentary takeover - would no doubt agree.) It's settled, then: the duelists will choose appropriate hosts, and using the humans as instruments, duel for Ariadne for the final time. The situation leaves Ariadne with no alternative but to comply, despite her misgivings: unless she chooses a corporeal form for herself, she will be powerless to avert another pointless tragedy. Having followed Ben to school, the interlopers look around them. Samuel chooses Darren as his victim, and Ariadne, Zoï¿½. But at the fateful moment, Darren and Zoï¿½ change places in the crowd - and Samuel's ectoplasm enters Zoï¿½'s body, and Ariadne's, Darren's. Tobias, who was heading for a larger and more aggressive host than poor Ben, is drawn helplessly back to his first choice: having once entered a human psyche, the ghosts are bound to that one and that one only. So the two duelists are now embodied in Ben and Zoï¿½ - and the sweet feminine mediator, in the hulking bully Darren. The scene is set for some ludicrous mismatches - and great bewilderment for the unwitting human hosts - until the children can figure out what is happening and how to take control of their own bodies again... ... But the only way to achieve that is to effect a reconciliation between the ghosts - and it takes the very real danger of losing both Darren and Ariadne forever before Samuel and Tobias come to their senses, and in setting the children free once more, free themselves. Being the new girl is often rather frightening, even at a conventional school, so for Rosa Martinelli (13) to have been accepted into the School of the Performing Arts is something of a mixed blessing. It came at a topsy-turvy time in her life anyway: her father Nick and mother Brigid have just separated, and Brigid and Rosa are trying to figure out their new life on their own. Rosa's pleased to have delighted Brigid so much in taking the first step toward the dream of stardom - but is it Brigid's dream, or Rosa's own? Although Rosa's voice is pleasant, it is nothing extraordinary, and being naturally shy she doesn't enjoy the audition for her first school production. Pretty and spiteful Lucy - who is far more confident both in her talent and her social life than Rosa - doesn't empathize: she's delighted to have a new victim for her teasing, and the interest Brad - school hunk and erstwhile boyfriend of Lucy - takes in Rosa doesn't endear the new girl to her any further. Lucy gets the main part, Rosa takes a place in the chorus - but even this poses its problems: the actors must find their own costumes, and how can Brigid afford to buy Rosa a new dress? Rosa's eye is caught by a beautiful forties dress in the window of the local op shop. It fits her perfectly - as if it were made for her... But the dress was originally made for Julia - fascinating and charming, Julia was poised on the brink of stardom when she was tragically killed. And Julia plans to make the comeback of all time - from the grave... At first Julia's presence in Rosa's life seems benign - exciting, certainly. With Julia taking over Rosa's voice, "Rosa" stuns Mrs. Monmouth, her music teacher, with her overnight transformation into a student of extraordinary talent. But it's too late to recast the main part - until Lucy suffers an unfortunate accident. She insists a girl she has never seen before pushed her down the stairs ... and Rosa becomes faintly uneasy about her ghostly new friend. Rosa/Julia does the show to great acclaim - but at the end of the night Julia refuses to leave Rosa's body: she's out for a complete takeover. And when Rosa returns to consciousness she discovers she is trapped - trapped in the green dress... Luckless Lucy spots the dress hanging back in the window of the op shop. Intrigued, she tries it on - and discovers Rosa... Wearing the green dress, Lucy confronts Julia - with Rosa speaking through her. But Lucy has an ulterior motive: come to me, Julia - leave second-hand Rosa's body behind. With my looks and your talent, how can we fail...? Despite Rosa's frantic warning, Lucy invites Julia into her soul - and is trapped herself - trapped in the green dress. As for Rosa, she has realized there are many things she is no longer interested in giving up in pursuit of fame and fortune. Her dreams are her own. Emily Watson (12) and her widower father Sam are show people, and along with their faithful dog Pepper make a living moving through the small towns of 1950's North America giving performances and selling "Dr. Watson's Magical Elixir" - Sam's own herbal remedy for just about anything. Although Emily of course still grieves for her mother, she is happy with her unconventional life and upbringing. However, the Watsons' lives change forever when they rescue the beautiful and mysterious Grizelda. Grizelda is a newcomer in what appears to be just a run-of- the-mill New England town - but since her arrival, the old aunt she says she came to visit has never been seen, and the townspeople believe she has been murdered. Sam and Emily find Grizelda fleeing for her life. She explains that she, like Sam, is a healer, and is being accused by the villagers not only of murder but of witchcraft. Sam is fascinated by the young woman, who insinuates herself rapidly into the routine of the little family. She helps Sam with the preparation of his emulsions, Emily with the cooking, and even joins the magic act - but Pepper distrusts her from the start. Emily too notices a peculiar thing about Grizelda: periodically she succumbs to abrupt and violent headaches, which seem almost to turn her into another person. There is only one thing that will cure the malady: a potion of Grizelda's own making, which she is extremely secretive about. Emily happens into the caravan as Grizelda takes the potion, and is startled by the violence of Grizelda's reaction - she seems to think Emily has been spying on her. But what does Grizelda have to hide? Unused to sharing her father's attention, Emily is glad to arrive at Bitter Creek, the little town they visit every summer, and to meet up again with the friend she made there the previous year, the farm-boy Tom (14). But it is at Bitter Creek that Grizelda's true nature will be revealed... Sam has none of Emily's misgivings. In fact, Sam is a man in love - and to Emily's distress, they no sooner arrive at the market and set up their stall than her father and Grizelda are married. From this point on - her objective achieved - Grizelda has no further interest in trying to win Emily over. Angered by Pepper's protectiveness of his mistress, Grizelda makes the dog "vanish" during the magic show. Emily searches the tent after the show - and to her great shock finally finds a frog: a frog that barks. So Emily does spy on Grizelda, and uncovers the ghastly truth. Far from murdering her old aunt as she was accused of doing, the luscious and youthful Grizelda is the crone herself. Her "headaches" indicate that the spell is wearing off - which is why whenever they strike she must rush back to the caravan to take a fresh dose of potion ... When Emily tries to explain to her father how much and how dangerously they have been duped, he is horrified - horrified at Emily and her "lies". With not even Sam able to believe her, Emily takes the still-enchanted Pepper and the rest of Grizelda's potion, and with the help of loyal Tom steals away. Without the potion, Grizelda of course reverts back to her true shape. In a peculiarly ironic twist, Sam is accused of killing his lovely young wife and daughter - for where are they now...? Tom carries back news of Sam's trial to Emily, who is hiding in his barn. As the children set off to the rescue, the barn door swings open to reveal, triumphant, Grizelda - she has followed Tom back from the village to Emily and the potion! But the witch is no match for the ingenuity of the two children and Pepper. It seems only just that it is Grizelda's own wand which transforms her into a harmless black cat - running for its life before the dog she so cruelly transformed. The Craig family have always taken their annual holidays at the beach, in their quaint, much-loved Seaview Cottage. But this year things are poised to change for Sarah (11) and her brothers Peter (14) and Jack (16). Their father has lost his business, and unless the children can come up with a solution, they will lose the second home that has always meant so much to them. Peter and Jack have long grown out of digging for buried treasure, which is the only plan Sarah can come up with for restoring the family fortunes. Sarah is used to being the butt of her older brothers' jokes: when she really does make a find, she is not surprised that they won't pay her or it any attention. But there's something very special about this particular piece of jetsam. What Sarah has unearthed is a silver salver - valuable in itself, but far more importantly, containing the spirit of James Pierrepoint, pirate. Pierrepoint wants Sarah to find the key to release him from the four-hundred-year-old curse that has kept him prisoner. But the man who cast the curse originally is still very much around. The infamous Dr. Dee, Elizabethan alchemist and sorcerer, is posing in the town as an antique-dealer. He displays a sinister interest in both Sarah and the salver - for Dee he doesn't want this particular antique going anywhere ... At first a frightening and ghoulish figure, Pierrepoint warms to Sarah. He twice saves members of her family from danger - her brothers from a rock-slide, her mother Sylvia from a car accident - for as Dr. Dee tells her, "Things were a little muddled when the curse was made. Flashes of the future, nods and whispers about the past as well..." Four hundred years ago Pierrepoint marooned a relative of Dr. Dee's on a desert island. His punishment is to remain forever trapped in the salver, condemned to a waking death of never-ending cold and never-ending fever - unless the curse can be lifted ... but how can Sarah find the key? Pierrepoint shows Sarah one last vision: a little boy hurt and lost. When the search parties of the community fail to find him, and she cannot convince her family of what she saw in the salver, Sarah sets out, in desperation, to consult with Dr. Dee. Dee tells her the salver has one wish, and one wish only, for the person who finds it. Sarah is faced with a terrible choice: she can use the wish to find the little boy; she can save the cottage she and her brothers love so much by asking Pierrepoint to tell her where the accumulated treasure of his career of piracy is hidden; or she can set Pierrepoint himself free. If Pierrepoint has used his "flashes of the future" to help Sarah, surely she has an obligation to do what she can to help him in return? But the life of a child is at stake... It is the final irony, that in doing what Dee had never expected her to do and using her one wish for someone other than herself - apparently dashing both her own and Pierrepoint's dearest hopes in the process - that Sarah unwittingly unlocks the curse and sets Pierrepoint free. The key to the curse had always been an unselfish wish - and for four hundred years that one twist had been enough to keep Pierrepoint prisoner. Weary but content, Sarah throws the salver back into the sea and turns to say goodbye for the last time to the irascible old pirate - but he has gone forever. The only clue that he was ever there at all is what he has left her: a torn, ancient map ... to buried treasure. Cherry Painter (12) comes from a fascinating family. For three generations they have made their living as magicians - but with her father the tendency seems to be dying out. He and his funny, astute sister Linda, a great favorite and confidante of Cherry's, seem - unaccountably, in Cherry's eyes - to want nothing more than to lead ordinary lives. Cherry has the gift - she wants to be the first world-class female magician, and she cannot understand the others being seemingly more than content to leave show biz for menial jobs. But then, the very mention of her Granddad's famous act - which culminated in the trick known as "The Skeleton in the Cupboard" - seems to make her relatives nervous. Is there something that has been kept from her all these years? A final, disastrous show at the house of Cherry's deadly enemy, the smug and superior Donna Carver, clinches Mr. Painter's decision. He turns his wand and costume over to Linda for safekeeping, and takes a job as groundsman at Cherry's own school. The embarrassment! Cherry's furious - and her wisecracking friend Jimmy is for once of little help. It is up to Cherry, she decides, to rescue the family reputation - and a talent contest at school seems to provide her with the perfect opportunity. She will be tutored secretly by Aunty Linda, and with Jimmy as her (very reluctant) assistant put on a magic show that will both dazzle the school, and demonstrate to her father the error of his ways. Poking around in Linda's attic, Cherry finds a picture she has never seen before. There's her father, all right, and there's Linda, albeit twenty years younger, and there's her poor grandfather, as vibrant and domineering as he was before his stroke - but who is this other young man ... ? Under persistent questioning, Linda finally caves in. The man Cherry does not know is her uncle, Geoff, who was the star of the show and in Linda's generation certainly the one with the gift. But he vanished - truly and for good - during one of the "Skeleton in the Cupboard" shows, and was never seen again ... Neither Cherry's father nor grandfather can bear to hear his name mentioned. Linda was commissioned with destroying the "Skeleton" box, but could not bear to: here it is still, in the corner of her attic, a dazzlingly-painted and strangely fascinating object the size of a grown man... Perfect for her show, Cherry decides. But during the performance, Jimmy vanishes for real. Has the box taken him? At this point Geoff makes his first ever appearance in his niece's life. He had seen the article about Jimmy's mysterious disappearance - nothing less would have forced him to recontact the family he left so many years ago. He explains to Cherry that he knew the box was evil, and that he himself had been falling further and further under its spell. After one occasion when Linda, as his assistant, actually did vanish and was gone for several hours, Geoff was so frightened he wished to leave the show - but his competitive and difficult relationship with his own father, Cherry's Grandad, made it impossible ... so he staged a disappearance.

The IMF, the military and their secret service "comrades" start to plot against of the elected PM. They are unhappy with the non-nuclear and neutral aspirations of his party (during the Cold War) and are supported in their fears by nationalistic media moguls.

As his national-political consciousness grew he formed a wider agenda for a reinvestment in health and education as well as public ownership of public utilities. Harry maintains his drive despite sex scandals, the suicide of his Chancellor of the Exchequer's wife and the assassination of his trusted military advisor Monty Kowalski. Harry says that "the dead [read: his grandfather, Annette Newson and Monty] ask the best questions, and we are answerable". He finds some personal support in his ex-lover Helen, a passionate advocate for alternate economic strategies, and Harry's spy in the corridors of power; Thompson, an investigative journalist. But ultimately this is a story about one man's passion. There is a haunting sound of helicopters in the background on the second election day scene. One imagines; is this the day when democracy has gone too far? Will the military take over? Even in a country like the UK? Or is it just a media Helicopter trying to document the radical change?

ABC started this Saturday night series as a complement to its "ABC in Concert" running on Friday nights. Whereas the Friday show featured rock and pop musicians, this series, hosted by Billy Dean, focused on country and western singers such as Billy Ray Cyrus, and Travis Tritt. A revival of its old "Wide World of Entertainment" series from the 70's, this ABC series presented concert performances featuring a different rock or pop performer each week. Musical acts ranged from well-known performers like The Rolling Stones and Cher, to newer, up-and-coming acts like New Kids on the Block, Sinead O' Conner and Mariah Carey. These late-night concerts were also simultaneously broadcast on ABC radio. Created in an effort to dislodge Johnny Carson from his position of dominance in the late-night television field, this show featured young Les Crane as entertainer, host and moderator. While the basic format of the show was very similar to The Tonight Show, it was set apart by Crane's spontenaity, lack of respect for the traditions of TV production and penchant for breaking the fourth wall, which presaged such later hosts as David Letterman. These antics, however, were unfortunately not appreciated by critics of the day, and the show went off the air after just one year. Musical comedy special with three sketches. "Dressing Room Interruptions" the performing Hertz Brothers receive bad news just before show time. "Mr. Acropolis" A theater troupe use insane devices to win the sympathy of a heartless theater owner. "Ginsberg" A Charlie Chan with a Yiddish accent proves to be a hero to a damsel in distress. All join in the finale with "Together, Wherever We Go". The World Title is won at the Grand Prix of Italy in Monza by Mario Andretti. This show highlights his victories leading up to the race in Argentina, Belgium, France and Holland and coverage highlights of the Monza race itself. A major crash during the race by Andretti's teammate and friend Ronnie Peterson ends on a sad note with Peterson dying that night from injuries received in the crash. This show highlights the rivalry between two famous pool champs. Willie Mosconi, the technical advisor for "The Hustler" and the vocal, flamboyant Minnesota Fats, who claims the HUSTLER movie was about him. The $15,000 shootout match is framed with fascinating UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL segments with Willie Mosconi and Minnosota Fats, who was interviewed in his basement pool room. Fats talked a good game but in the end, couldn't deliver. Mosconi crushed Fats at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in New York City. They played 9-ball and Mosconi win in three sets.

This reality series followed three male US Air Force officers as they attended flight school at Tyndall Air Force Base in Panama City, Florida.

Viewers also saw how the officers' wives and families were affected by the high-stress environment. The series was cancelled after three episodes because of low ratings. In the fall of 2004, a spill of hundreds of gallons of thick crude oil in Seattle's Puget Sound, which no company owned up to, led an intrepid Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter from the SEATTLE POST-INTELLIGENCER to embark on an investigation into the actual state of the Pacific Northwest's oil transport industry. Alf and his friends from Melmac spoof and retell some classic stories (such as Robin Hood, Cinderella, The Legend of Sleepy Hollow etc...) in only the way that ALF could. The Tanner family is an average American family. One day, they discover that they have a visitor. He's small, he's furry, he's arrogant, and he's an alien from the planet Melmac. Unsure what to do, they name him ALF: Alien Life Form. Alf soon decides that as much as he misses his home planet, there's a lot to be said for Earth: the Tanners are willing to concede anything as long as he doesn't announce his presence. Oh yeah, the Tanners also have a cat, which looks rather tasty... ALF and Kate's mom are arguing about TV. Kate's mom thinks ALF's favorite soap opera, Midwest General, is sleaze, and shows him her favorite, One World to Hope For, which ALF thinks is boring. Angered, ALF argues that he could write a better script for the series than the writers are coming up with. So ALF actually writes a script and sends it in. The production company actually films ALF's script that bears not-so-subtle similarities to the situation at the Tanners' house... The whole story starts here as Gordon Shumway, a Melmacian who escaped his planet before it was destroyed, crash lands into the garage of the Tanner family. The Tanners call him "ALF" because he is an Alien Life Form and they decide to keep his presence a secret so that the U.S. Government will not take away the space being and subject him to experiments. From the beginning, there is no sanity for the Tanner family. The Tanners decide to spend Christmas in a cabin in the woods. They meet Mr. Fowley, a man that fixes broken toys during the year and gives them to kids in the hospital over Christmas. Alf accidentally gets caught in Mr. Fowley's truck as he drives off with Alf and the "rest" of the toys in the back. In the hospital, where the toys are handed out, Alf meets Tiffany, a very sweet, but very sick girl. Alf rushes back to Tiffany and decides to stay with her for a while. When he finally leaves her, he gets lost in the hospital and gets stuck in the elevator together with a young lady in labor. While in the elevator, Alf helps the soon-to-be mother to bring her child to the world. Alf gets back into Mr Fowleys truck after learning that Mr. Fowley gives away all his belongings because his wife recently passed. He plans to end his life because he cannot be without his life. Thankfully, Alf intervenes. Meanwhile, the Tanners are out in the woods looking for Alf and miss him very much. When they are reunited, the Christmas becomes a truly special Christmas. Lynn is going to a concert with her friend and is waiting to get the car for the evening... but Willie and Kate are late and the girls are in danger of being late for the concert. Then Willie and Kate arrive... with the help a tow truck. The tow truck man estimates that the repairs will cost way over 3,000 dollars - not good. Lynn is upset and wishes for another car. ALF asks why Willie doesn't buy Lynn a car and Willie has to explain that they can't afford it - especially since a lot of money went into repairing the garage roof because ALF crash-landed on it. Lynn wants to start saving money by getting a job, but her parents aren't sure she can balance school and work. And she can't. Cue ALF to the rescue... or should we say a disaster? ALF is now into gardening, which means he's turned over the entire Tanner's backyard. Willie has a problem at work: a lost Mexican boy is at his office and Willie is trying to track down his father. When that fails, and Willie's boss couldn't care less about helping the boy, Willie has no option but to bring the boy home. ALF thinks he's won in a publisher's sweepstakes, but the actual truth is that he subscribed to "hundreds of magazines" (Willie probably exaggerates here)... The next leaflet ALF gets his hands on *does* promise free gifts, but only if the family comes to listen a sales pitch for vacation homes. The Ochmoneks are going there, so Trevor invites the Tanners to come along. Turns out he is a pilot who flew in the Korean war, so they are able to fly instead of a seven-hour drive. The reluctant Willie eventually warms to the idea, but ALF has to stay home. Or is it that he should stay home? When ALF picks up a signal on the Tanner's radio, he realizes that it is someone trying to get in touch with him through Melmacian code. He cracks the codes and finds that it's two of his friends who want to pick him and take him to their new planet. He agrees to meet them unaware that the Alien Task Force is onto them. Lynn is excited because "Scott" wants to keep all his band equipment in the Tanner's garage. Willie is not so excited. Lynn is interested in Scott and begs for Willie to allow Scott to keep the equipment in their garage for just two days. Willie gives her his permission. ALF is not happy - he was supposed to be re-decorating his room with Lynn. And he also has a crush on Lynn, so he proceeds to sabotage Scott's time with Lynn while trying to come up with something to impress her. Alf feels lonely and has no one to talk to outside the family. Through a radio show he learns about a lonely blind woman named Judy, who is afraid of connecting to people, as she often feels like an outcast and fears that people reject her because she is so different. Since Alf feels the same way, he gets in contact with Judy. Soon, they become phone pals. After some time, they decide that it is time to meet one another, but Willy and Kate strongly oppose Alf meeting someone outside the family. Lynn decides to help Alf meet Jody and they make a plan to make sure that Judy does not find out that Alf is an alien. Brian has to lie to his friend who wants to come for a sleepover that the Tanner's basement is flooded, because ALF must be kept secret. Willie then tries to explain to Brian that lying is always wrong even though Brian has to keep lying because of ALF. Lying to the Ochmonecks is also tiring Willie, not to mention having to put up with ALF's antics. Kate suggests Willie talk to Larry, a therapist they know. Of course, Willie has to prove that ALF exists and is not his hallucination, which means that Larry and ALF meet. Brian's 7th birthday is approaching and it gets ALF depressed, because he realizes he's never going to see his friends on Melmac again - he was finally going to get together with his true love Rhonda and then the planet exploded. In sleep, ALF dreams about his 228th birthday on Melmac, just before the explosion. In order to cheer ALF up, Brian and Willie start broadcasting into space, in hopes of finding another survivor from Melmac. ALF decides to try ventriloquism. He gets a dummy whom he names Paul. And Paul is obnoxious and drives everyone crazy. Not knowing what to so, they ask the psychiatrist who knows about ALF to come and hopefully tell them what's going on with ALF and Paul. Willie catches ALF from eating a box of chocolate that was to be a Valentine's Day present for Kate. This incites Willie to give ALF a lecture on how ALF does not respect private property and needs to adopt a new attitude. Also, Kate's mom is moving out of the Tanners' house. The problem is that her new neighbor, Whizzer, wants to come help Dorothy move her stuff. Which means ALF has to hide from him. Kate likes Whizzer and suggests that they invite him over for a dinner. Dorothy doesn't want that. ALF interjects by claiming to have spoken to Dorothy's dead husband Sparky's spirit, who wants Dorothy to move on. Apparently, all Melmacians have the ability to speak to the dead. Dorothy wants ALF to prove his ability and let her speak to Sparky through ALF... Lynn has introduced ALF to rap music, much to Willie's dislike. Willie himself is making the final changes to Brian's song in the school pageant where the kids dress as vegetables. Unfortunately, Brian is suffering from stage fright, which causes him to forget the lyrics. ALF offers to help... Willie and Kate miss the days when they would visit friends' dinner parties and then reciprocate. They decide to host a luau with a roasted pig. They invite only the people who've invited them to dinner, but end up with everyone from the office at work. Alf tries to strong arm trash rights, but ends up having to agree to watch from the upstairs. The party is rained out, all the guests have to come inside, a drunk guest sees the family dog making a sandwich. Alf is locked in the shed and breaks out. At the end of the episode, Alf is reading a Transformers comic. It's Willie's birthday. ALF gives him a box he found in the basement. It's full of photos from high school and college. There's also a menu, on the back of which Kate and Willie both made lists of things they wanted to achieve in life. Kate actually did the things on her list, but Willie did not. This starts to haunt him so badly that he decides to do the list. Gordon (A.L.F.) is insulted when the Tanners consider him a parasite, free-loader, sponger. He tries to make money to be less of a burden on the family, but puts Willie's VISA card over the limit purchasing "Terry Faith Cosmetics" to sell at a house party. After ALF invites a tabloid crew over to the Tanner household for an interview, they take a few photos before Willie asks them to leave. However, when it is learned that ALF might be in one of those photos, Willie must stall the crew so that ALF and Brian can go into their van and destroy the film. There's a power blackout, so ALF is passing the time by watching the Tanners' neighbors, the Ochmoneks, who are fighting. By dinner time, the power has come back so the Tanners can have dinner. Then comes another, short blackout. Trevor Ochmonek appears at the Tanners' door, seeking peace and quiet from the angry Raquel. Soon after, Raquel comes to demand that Trevor return home. The Tanners persuade him to do so. Night falls and ALF hears the Ochmoneks continue fighting. Suddenly it becomes silent. Too silent for ALF, who's convinced that something foul has happened at the Ochmoneks... With ALF feeling bored and useless, Larry advises the Tanners to ask for his opinion on their problems and make him feel more important. However, this plan backfires when ALF decides that he wants to become a shrink and starts to analyze everything they say and do. Kate's mother, who is not on warm terms with Willie, arrives for a surprise visit that forces the Tanners to lock ALF in the garage for "a few days". The problem is that ALF just can't stand being not allowed to roam around in the house, with all the luxuries found there. So he just has to do something. Willie suggests that they go to San Diego on holiday. Kate is all for it, but there's a slight problem: what to do with ALF? Since leaving ALF alone is a recipe for disaster, the family takes him along for the road trip. However, the weather turns stormy, ALF gets bored of sitting in the RV and starts complaining. Willie goes mental and shows ALF the door. Defiantly, ALF wanders off. Gordon (A.L.F.), having lost his planet in an explosion, becomes very concerned about earth's nuclear proliferation. He uses Willie's short wave radio to contact the President of the United States aboard Airforce One - to the great displeasure of the FBI. When ALF finds out that a local corporation is using CFCs that pollute the environment, he writes several letters of protest, all under fake names. When the corporation threatens with legal action, Willie goes over to meet with them only to have them try to buy his silence by offering him a high-paying job. Everybody but Brian and ALF are leaving the house for the evening and Kate doesn't want ALF to babysit Brian, so Willie calls their ever-snooping Mrs. Ochmonek from the neighbor. ALF is told to stay in the bedroom, but when Mrs. Ochmonek starts to watch Psycho, which ALF wants to see, he can't resist sneaking out of the bedroom. Mrs. Ochmonek is in for some unusual experiences. The Tanners are preparing for a garage sale to get some money for house payments. ALF discovers the alluring world of horse racing thanks to Kate's mom who bets on them. When the concept of a bookie is explained to ALF, he gets the bright idea of getting the Tanners some money through betting. When his initial bets yield only profit, the plan seems good... at the time. ALF still believes that his name is Wayne Schlagel and that he's an insurance agent. Worse still, he has called the police to the Tanners. The Tanners have only a short while before the police arrive, so they try to make ALF remember who he really is by telling more stories from the past - cue more clips from earlier episodes. When the living room TV breaks down, Willie declares that he won't have it fixed, despite ALF's complaints that he has nothing to do but watch TV. ALF keeps pressuring Willie, who discovers that the TV is still under warranty and he can have it sent to the factory for repairs. Except that the factory is in Libya and Willie would have to pay for shipping... ALF thinks Willie has been conned, so he calls Consumer Ed, the guy who fights for consumers' rights on TV... Brian announces that he needs to come up with a project for the Science Carnival. On his own, Brian creates a model of the Solar System. ALF points out that there are inaccuracies and offers to help. ALF starts to go through a phase where his erratic behavior and hunger for cats will, in his own words, make him "ALF to the tenth power". He wants Willie to build a cage where he can be locked in until the phase is over. Will the cage be strong enough? Can they keep him locked in when he tries to plot himself out? Everything from cobblers to cookies, puddings to pies, and even cupcakes are made. Chef Ani's easy-to-make raw sweets are wheat-, gluten-, dairy-, processed sugar-, and cruelty-free. Deceptively simple, these treats pack loads of flavor and nutrition in every bite. Her recipes include Raspberry Ganache Fudge Cake and Lemon Pudding Filled Coconut Cupcakes. On this episode, Ani showed us how to make Oatmeal Raisin cookies. National Motocross Championships in the 125cc, 250cc and 500cc divisions. In the two years leading up to 1990 Jean-Michel Bayle served notice that he could win indoors or out, and on any sized bike. He won 125, 250 and 500 Nationals, as well as a handful of AMA Supercross mains, within the first calendar year of his U.S. campaign. So when he put a stop to embittered teammate Jeff Stanton's championship winning streak at two with a resounding AMA Supercross Championship, Stanton seemed to begrudge not only Bayle's seemingly effortless, natural ability, as well as his close friendship with Honda team manager Roger DeCoster. There was also an issue with the fans. This was the era of the first Gulf War, and the announcers in the AMA Supercross series fanned flames of resentment towards the foreigner by simply being over-the-top, pro-American in their race calls. JMB used the abrasive booing for motivation, and that made the fans boo him even more. Not a great moment for anyone, including Stanton and Bradshaw, both of whom seemed to get pulled into it simply because they were American heroes. Jean-Michel Bayle's takeover of American Motocross in 1991 was a shocker, but his motivation for the 1992 season was just as surprising. At about the same time JMB was getting the number one plates bolted onto his 1992 Honda CRs, he announced that he would quit motocross and supercross at the end of the season and embark on a road racing career for 1993. Even for the enigmatic Bayle, this was crazy! Indeed, JMB did not have the same motivation for dirt bike racing in 1992, while his Honda teammate Stanton showed up leaner, meaner and determined to get the titles he lost in '91 back. But both of them would soon have to take a back seat to Team Yamaha's Damon Bradshaw, who was coming of age in his third year in the 250 class. Bradshaw won five SX races in a row early in the '92 Camel Supercross campaign, while Stanton and Bayle were struggling on their new Hondas, which were totally revamped from the previous year's models. But Bradshaw crashed away his entire points lead at Indianapolis, and let the Honda boys back in the hunt. What followed was a nip-and-tuck battle for the supercross points lead between the three, with Bayle showing occasional, inspired glimpses of his '91 form, Bradshaw riding aggressively (which was good at times and bad at others) and Stanton staying in the hunt in his typical workman form. This is a talk show hosted by Frances Scully; guest star Gary Gray appeared on the April 25, 1951 show, promoting the new MGM Technicolor film, "The Painted Hills," that starred Gary Gray and Lassie - it would be Lassie's last film, as she was replaced by her offspring for the TV series.

Nice Guy Keiichi is doing his best as a poor student at a tech college, but his good nature is taken advantage of relentlessly. One day he is attempting to order a pizza over the phone (being stuck at the dorm to take messages for upperclassmen) and by fate reaches the Goddess Help Line. Before he knows it he is presented with a real live goddess named Belldandy who will grant him one and only one wish. Still suspecting he is the butt of an elaborate joke, he wishes for her to be by his side forever. His wish is granted! It would seem his luck has changed, but he finds out that having a goddess is no way to avoid trouble. Skuld still can't accept sharing her sister Belldandy with anyone, let alone Keiichi. In an effort to prove herself more worthy than him, Skuld decides to build a labor-saving device that will serve and protect Belldandy from harm, the First Class Demon Mara, and especially from Keiichi! However, Skuld is a more skillful mechanical genius than she thought, and the labor-saving device begins reprogramming itself! While the Goddesses hold the CD that can trap her in Limbo, First Class Demon Marller finds a human to make a deal with, letting her defeat the Goddesses and fulfill her mission on Earth at the same time. And when Sayoko says yes to Marller, Keiichi finds himself torn from his feelings for Belldandy and paying more attention to Sayoko. Will Keiichi revoke the holy contract by saying he no longer wants Belldandy by his side forever, and send her back to Heaven? Not if big sister Urd has anything to say about it! The holy contract between Keiichi and Belldandy is unprecedented and unique, but there are those in Heaven who want to see it kept as well as those who want to see it broken...because the contract has caused the Heavenly mainframe, Yggdrassil, to crash and cause havoc in Heaven and Earth...and Belldandy has become ill for the first time in her knowledge. As a result, an emissary from Heaven comes to "assist"...only she does so without permission and with her own private agenda for Keiichi and Belldandy, starting with an otherwise innocent looking videotape! Settled into their new home and settling in at school, Keiichi realizes that he has not been able to express his growing feeling of romance for Belldandy. Afraid that his shyness towards beautiful women and Belldandy in particular will cause her to lose interest, Keiichi seeks a way to declare his love for her...if only he can overcome that inability to express himself in a forthright manner! A young woman hitchhikes from Hokkaido to see Keiichi Morisato, only to discover that he is living with the "beautiful foreigner", Belldandy. It is his sister, Megumi, who has come ahead of her graduation to find a place to live when she goes to school the following month. The search is arduous, but when the place she finds is too good to be true...it is, and the Goddess Belldandy must take control of the situation. Now under one roof with two Goddesss, Keiichi Morisato finds it difficult to ride herd on both in order to prevent people from discovering their powers. And it doesn't help matters when both Sayoko and Aoshima, who have seen their power at work, decide to expose them to the world! Now that they are settled in, Keiichi has to return to school...and Belldandy asks to come along. However, Campus Queen Sayoko Mishima sees the beautiful Belldandy as severe and absolute competition that she must crush and destroy...even if it means stealing Keiichi away from Belldandy! Innocent of Earthly and Japanese customs, Belldandy is educated on the White Day/Valentine's Day tradition by Keiichi's sister, Megumi. However, when it comes time to give Keiichi his gift, Belldandy finds that she doesn't know what a "romantic setting" is. Unfortunately, jealous Sayoko offers to "help" by introducing Belldandy to her cousin, wealthy playboy Aoshima Toshyuki...who is more than willing to show Belldandy what a "romantic setting" is in his own mind.

Sasshi and Arumi find themselves in what appears to be a Western-style fairytale castle, with Papan (Arumi's dad) as the King and Ms. Aki as the Queen. They ask the young kids to slay a vicious demon and they give them some gold coins to buy equipment. Unfortunately, Arumi spends all of the coins to buy an amulet and Sasshi is continuously killed and revived, because he has no weapons.

Sasshi is mistaken for a legendary sniper and forced to become part of the mafia, while Arumi becomes a policewoman with other two agents Mune-Mune and Sayaka.

Huge final shootout between the policemen and the mafiosi, while Mune-Mune finally meets Yutas and asks him why he always seems to ignore her.

However, it becomes clear that they can't go home because Sasshi does not want to. Sasshi and Arumi, instead of going back home, are transported to a Sci-Fi version of the Abenobashi shopping center. They find the Abeno Angels (who are really Mune-Mune, Sasshi's older sister Sayaka and Ms. Aki), a trio of scantily-clad space heroines who moonlight as Space Pirates! Sasshi and Arumi become pilots of a giant robot, followed by Masa-ji (as the old professor who never does anything) and Papan (as a robot), to defeat the oni who stole Arumi's panties and turned into a giant enemy robot!

But behind the pure strains of patriotism loomed a different conflict. Struggling to identify its allies and opponents, the U.S. Government incarcerated Pacific Coast Japanese-American citizens in internment camps - a decision that has been questioned and hotly debated in the 60-some years since WWII.

So imagine his surprise when Fiona, a needy single mom and her oddly charming 11-year-old son, Marcus, move in next door and disrupt his perfect world. When Marcus begins dropping by his home unannounced, Will's not so sure about being a kid's new best friend, until, of course, Will discovers that women find single dads irresistible. That changes everything and a deal is struck: Marcus will pretend to be Will's son and, in return, Marcus is allowed to chill at Will's house, play ping-pong and gorge on steaks, something his very vegan mom would never allow. Before he realizes it, Will starts to enjoy the visits and even finds himself looking out for the kid. In fact, this newfound friendship may very well teach him a thing or two that he never imagined possible - about himself and caring for others. Andy (Al Madrigal) guilts Will (David Walton) into agreeing to babysit Marcus (Benjamin Stockham) so Fiona (Minnie Driver) can go on a job interview, but the situation gets complicated when they receive a last-minute invitation to a once-in-a-lifetime charity pool party hosted by rap star Lil Jon (guest star as himself). Meanwhile, Fiona discovers that honesty isn't always the best policy when it comes to landing a job. With Fiona (Minnie Driver) putting in extra hours at work, Marcus (Benjamin Stockham) finally gets his own house key, but he quickly loses his mom's trust when Will (David Walton) has to rush him to the emergency room following an untimely incident with a knife. However, Marcus' misfortune has a silver lining for Will when he crosses paths with Dr. Samantha Lake (guest star Adrianne Palicki), a beautiful and charming doctor who comes to Marcus' aid. Will is instantly smitten and stops at nothing in his attempts to win her over - even if it means bending the truth. Marcus (Benjamin Stockham) asks Will (David Walton) for advice on how he can get Hannah (guest star Cricket Wampler) to invite him to her upcoming birthday party. When that proves unsuccessful, Fiona (Minnie Driver) takes it to task with Joanne (guest star Andrea Anders), Hannah's mother, who also happens to be the queen bee of a group of neighborhood moms that she is trying to win over. Will (David Walton) attempts a much-needed boy's night out with Andy (Al Madrigal), but complications arise, leaving Will to reach out to Marcus (Benjamin Stockham) in hopes of salvaging the evening. When Andy later becomes available, he attempts to track down Will, but instead winds up bonding over the joys of parenting with Fiona (Minnie Driver). Meanwhile, Andy and his reluctant wife Laurie (guest star Annie Mumolo) solicit Will to be godfather to their son Jonah. Will (David Walton) is completely heartbroken when Sam (guest star Adrianne Palicki) receives a job opportunity she can't refuse in New York, prompting Fiona (Minnie Driver) and Marcus (Benjamin Stockham) to try their best to comfort their friend. With her absence weighing on his mind, Will turns to Andy (Al Madrigal) for his sage advice in figuring out how to best move forward. After writing a hit song, Will Freeman (David Walton) was granted a life of free time, free love and freedom from financial woes. He is single, unemployed and loving it.

Experience the captivating beauty of the Santa Barbara region from the air. Shot in high-definition from a helicopter, the film sweeps across the county and reveals, as never seen before, its breathtaking landscape and coastline. The narration brings historical highlights to life. The original music score is sublime. D.C.I. Langton takes charge when the body of would-be model Louise Pennell is found,sliced in half and with her mouth mutilated into a smile. D.C. Anna Travis discovers that newspaper journalist Richard Reynolds had received anonymous typed letters from somebody likening the murder to that of a girl nick-named the Black Dahlia in America in 1947,which was never solved. The letters call Louise the Red Dahlia. Her flat-mate tells Anna that Louise has answered an advertisement for a personal assistant and was receiving gifts from a mysterious older man. Then Richard gets a phone call,which he tapes,from somebody claiming to be the killer. Richard is sent Louise's hand-bag containing cosmetics which are long off the shelf and seem old-fashioned. A letter formed in news print also states that Louise 'deserved it' and another woman will die. Anna interviews a girl who answered the same advertisement as Louise but was turned down as unsuitable. In fact the next victim is Louise's flat-mate Sharon. Langton wants a press veto on the new murder but Richard,having gone through Anna's bag after a one night stand,makes it front page news and Anna angrily breaks with him. The description given by the dead girls' landlady of Louise's visitor fits that of divorcee Charles Wickenham,even down to an unusual ring he wears. He is an arrogant former army doctor,living with his three rather dysfunctional children and a house-keeper but he would seem to have an alibi for Louise's murder. Through phone-tapping Langton discovers that Wickenham performed an abortion on nervous younger daughter Emily,possibly his child as he had also abused arrogant elder daughter Justine. The family,including ex-wife Dominique,close ranks but Anna is given photos of Justine and Dominique at sex parties,the latter,an ex-prostitute,having sex with her stepson Edward. Mrs. Hedges,the housekeeper and fiercely protective of the girls,also believes Emily was abused but the biggest breakthrough comes from Edward's bullied girl-friend Gail,who rang the police naming Charles Wickenham,having seen him with the two victims. The murderer is finally cornered and exposed as a man who killed in the style of the Black Dahlia out of vanity,to see if he could get away with it. He escapes and hides in a ventilator shaft,where he is found dead,locked in to suffocate,assuredly by the housekeeper,still protective of her girls,though she is not arrested. Young Detective Constable Anna Travis joins the team led by D.C.I. Langton to investigate a series of gruesome murders of young women, which first began eight years previously. All the victims were prostitutes and all killed in the same way. Then a seventh body is found but this is the corpse of a student, though a vital piece of evidence links her death to the others, involving a house in Manchester where Alan Daniels, a popular young actor, grew up. Anna goes undercover to get to know him better but finds herself getting emotionally involved. Langton allows Anna to spend an evening at the ballet with the prime suspect, a handsome actor on the brink of stardom. A discovery at the place where one of the victims lived helps Anna set a trap. Meanwhile, sparks fly between Anna and Langton. In Mexico someone is having plastic surgery. On a London estate disgraced ex-cop Frank Brandon is found shot dead in a crack den and Anna,now an inspector,joins the hunt for the killer. Frank had a girl-friend but had recently married Julia Larson,a wealthy Danish woman for whom he has briefly worked as her chauffeur. She is evasive in interview and seemingly fearful. Evidence suggests that somebody was with Frank when he died and although only two bullets entered Frank residents heard three shots fired.Jeremy,an autistic youth,proves an enormous help as he has noted down the registration numbers of cars parked outside the murder scene that night. The drivers are Silas Roache,a big-time pusher trying to import the lethal American drug known as Drop Dead,small-time crook and customer Eddie Court and Danny Petrozzo. Roache is arrested,to the annoyance of drugs squad officer DCI Power,who had been surveying his operation.Eddie claims he left Frank alive with Danny but when Danny's vehicle is located Danny is inside and very dead. Whilst Roache admits to shooting Frank in a panic he denies killing Danny. Middle-class drop-out and user Julian D'Anton's prints are on Danny's car though Langton considers him too small-time to be a murderer. From a photograph Anna identifies Julia's ex-husband Collingwood as an international criminal and asks Sam Power to contact the FBI for details of his crimes in America,though Julia denies all knowledge,even after her accountant,Rushton,is found dead. Anna and Langton visit Julia's homely sister Helga and her husband Damian,an Oxford professor,at their remote farm though they claim to have had little contact with Julia and either of her husbands. Julia confesses that she knew her husband,whom she knew as Anthony Collingwood but was really global drug smuggler Alexander Fitzpatrick,was into murky dealings when he left for Mexico a year earlier,persuading her to marry Frank to deflect suspicion of association with Fitzpatrick though she was unaware of the scale of his criminality. Rushton looked after the account containing Fitzpatrick's ill-gotten gains and was killed because he aimed to decamp with them.Julia herself is killed soon after Langton releases her. A fraud squad inspector visits Langton but this proves to be Fitzpatrick in disguise,to discover the whereabouts of Julius,who stole all the Drop Dead after finding them in Danny's car. Fitzpatrick retrieves his haul after killing Julius's wife but a vital clue is provided when DNA matching that found at the crack den matches that at Helga's farm-house and she admits to sheltering Fitzpatrick on his return to England after his operation in Mexico. She was Fitzpatrick's lover before he met Julia and still loves him. However she agrees to tell Langton where Fitzpatrick is,leading to an arrest at St. Pancras station and a chase at a private air strip. Angered at being passed over for promotion to commander in favour of the younger,less experienced Sam Power,Langton knows it is because of his failure to capture drug dealer Fitzpatrick and believes a staff member informed on him. He now heads the investigation into the murder of temperamental,promiscuous film star Amanda Delany who slept with married men and had a hysterectomy following an abortion and was seemingly about to embark on tell-tale memoirs. She mistrusted her agent Andrea Lesser as being greedy and was estranged from her parents.However Langton and Anna Travis are more interested in a crucifix found on the corpse and apparently not hers. The day before the murder Amanda told her stand-in she had been woken in the night by a woman's scream and her ex-drama school colleagues in the squat she once shared with them tell the police that she would silently scream in her sleep. Then one of them is killed. The police interview Amanda's three actor lovers - Scott Myers and Sean O'Dell admit to a threesome with her after which Sean owns to losing his crucifix. Amanda's stuffed toy rabbit in which she kept her drugs has also gone.

But during the singing duos rehearsal process an incident occurs that might prevent them from fulfilling their dream. With spin doctors ery much in the spotlight of late, this TV adaption of the BBC radio series could hardly have picked a better time to rear its head. The show centres around the workings of Prentiss McCabe, a PR agency whose offices play host to a succession of minor celebrities, politicians and high-up businessmen who all need photo-shoots arranging and soundbites composing. Ethics are not a priority; the firm's staff will lie, cheat and possibly steal as long as it makes their clients look good. After serving his prison sentence, Charles returns to the office to find that the firm's latest client is Dean Wheelwright, an artist hotly tipped to win this year's Turner Prize - if only he can be persuaded to accept the invitation to enter. The Home Secretary asks Charles and Martin to devise a PR campaign to promote the highly unpopular proposed National Identity Card scheme, and, with the office telephones behaving strangely, the staff begin to suspect they are under surveillance by MI5, with Alison's resulting paranoia leading her to take the most drastic of steps. Charles and Martin are engaged by the US Ambassador to reverse the UK's growing hatred of all things American. Meanwhile, Jamie and Alison endeavor to help Peter Harrow, a long-standing client of Prentiss McCabe, who has grown tired of his "TV's Mr Nice Guy" image and is looking to change it for something a little nastier. The staff at Prentiss McCabe are split into two teams to tackle both sides of the same issue: the future of the House of Lords. Charles' services are engaged by a Downing Street aide to work on reforming the Second Chamber, while those of Martin are engaged by a Member of the House in order to preserve it in its current state.

Absolute X was distributed by Marker Entertainment, Directed by Clinton Graham Walker and edited by Cory Sparkuhl. Edina Monsoon and her best friend Patsy drive Eddie's sensible daughter, Saffron, up the wall with their constant drug abuse and outrageous selfishness. Numerous in-jokes and heavy doses of cruel humour have made this series a cult hit in the UK and abroad. Much aided by clips from previous shows, Eddy presents her documentary 'A Day in My Life - Moments in the Life of a Woman of Her Time', with a scene filmed at the Help the Aged shop where Mother is a volunteer. Mother cannot be bothered, causing a rueful Eddy to blame her for her unhappy childhood whilst Patsy was also no help at school because she got the boys whilst Eddy just got fat. In fact, some things really don't seem to have changed at all. After Patsy burns down Eddy's kitchen with a cigarette, Eddy has to get the workmen in to redecorate in a Japanese style and cause everybody to use the lounge as their main living room. Saffy, expecting a boyfriend, and Eddy and Patsy are accidentally locked in the room by Mother, and, in anticipation of Saffy's date, Eddy decides to tell her the facts of life, leading to the three women exchanging stories of their births. Eventually the door is unlocked and Eddy finds Saffy's date waiting outside. On Eddy's fortieth birthday, which she is dreading, Saffy cooks her a special meal but the guests are not the celebrities Eddy had wanted but her mother, her ex-husbands Justin and his boyfriend Oliver and Marshall with his American girlfriend Mo, plus Patsy. Eddy is an ungracious birthday girl, alienating her guests and finally retreating upstairs from the basement kitchen to get stoned with Patsy while her ex-husbands plan to cut off her alimony. Saffy is preparing for her home birth and Patsy is getting ready for an awards ceremony but Saffy's water breaks all over Patsy's expensive dress, which is further ruined when Mother tries to iron it, thus allowing Katy Grin to gleefully take Patsy's place at the ceremony. When John accidentally causes a power cut Bo and Marshall seize their chance to steal the new-born baby as part of their Christian Adoption scheme to sell children to film stars who don't want to be seen pregnant. However in the confusion they leave with the placenta and Eddy is the proud grand-mother of baby Jane (or Lola, as she would prefer to name her.) Saffy is visited by an ante-natal midwife who takes a dislike to Eddy, causing her to have nightmares in which the baby - who resembles the midwife - is trying to stab her. Patsy's contribution to the pregnancy is to give Saffy advice on abortions. The elegant 'Plum' arrives for the women's book club but the main topic tends to be celebrity gossip magazines and little is accomplished. However when John, the baby's father, arrives and Eddy sees that he is a black student Saffy met in Africa and is now living in London, she is overjoyed at the notion of being the grandmother to a mixed raced baby. Whilst Saffy is away in Africa doing voluntary work, Eddy has obtained a posh new bathroom but the rest of the house is a mess. Ex-Spice Girl Emma Bunton, one of Eddy's new clients, comes to visit. She was at school with Saffy and knows she hates untidiness so urges Eddy and Patsy to clean the house, which they do - after a fashion. When Saffy arrives home Eddy thinks she has put on weight but in fact she is pregnant. Patsy is angry when Eddy refuses to go away with her for Christmas, preferring to stay at home with the family and ordering a tree so large Patsy gets her hair caught in it. Patsy collapses - due to an unseen hand sticking a pin in an effigy of her - and is rushed to hospital, where at least she can spend Christmas on drugs. Eddy welcomes both her ex-husbands, Justin being quizzed on his sexuality by John and Bo and Marshall promoting their slimming product, and a family Christmas is indeed the order of the day - until the hospital informs Eddy that 'Miss Stone has died'. Thus we discover the identity of her ill-wisher, though Patsy herself recovers, only to choke on a piece of turkey back at Eddy's house. Eddy and Patsy accompany Emma Bunton to the live comedy charity telethon Comic Relief though Eddy falls out with Emma by suggesting that she should use the occasion for self-publicity and by failing to recognise the event's organizer,meaning that Emma's appearance has to be reschedueled. Eddy is,of course,only too happy to fill the breach and sing a song of her own before she and Patsy,who has wet herself through stage fright,get thrown out. When Eddy's father dies she is pretty apathetic until it makes her realise her own mortality,so she sets about buying some works of art that she can leave to the nation when she passes on. After Saffy bans her from the funeral she gets drunk with Patsy and the pair of them arrive at the churchyard where they fall into open graves,leaving Mother to explain their behaviour. Eddy is worrying about her weight again,seeing herself as the 'donkey' of her social circle,a fact that her bitchy friends endorse,so she goes on a punishing diet and exercise regime which,for different reasons Saffy and Patsy oppose. She even has dreams in which God and the Devil appear to add their own comments but,even though she feels she has shed the pounds she is still regarded as the donkey.Saffy is encouraged to write a play by Taylor,an actor friend seeking to revive his career. To Saffy's annoyance not only has Eddy forgotten her birthday but has failed to redecorate the kitchen after the fire. Eddy agrees to start work but ends up flying to New York with Patsy on the Concorde in pursuit of a suitable door knob she once saw there. In the event she photographs it but spends the day sight-seeing and getting her navel pierced. On arrival home she fails to notice that Saffy has had the kitchen renovated in her absence. After Mother gets banned from the house following the mess when she brought her friends over for a 'Coccoon' spa day in the bathroom,Saffy is without a babysitter whilst she spends the day with John and reluctantly acquiesces when Eddy tells her she wants to be a responsible grandparent and mind Jane (or even Lola) for her. She and Patsy take the baby for a photo shoot at the zoo and almost end up swapping her for a baby chimp. However after a session in the baby-changing toilet Eddy happily brings home her charge - only to discover that it is someone else's child. P.R. consultant Edina - Eddy - Monsoon wakes up with a hangover - again - but gets no sympathy from sensible student daughter Saffy as she had promised Saffy she would book into a clinic. Eddy is organizing a fashion show later in the day but the celebrities keep dropping out and finally,encouraged by her equally alcoholic friend magazine editor Patsy Stone, Eddy pulls off a successful show by blackmailing stars into taking part. In the evening she gets Patsy to phone Saffy pretending to be from the clinic awaiting Eddy's admission. Edina has put on weight and has trouble getting into her clothes so she is horrified when her secretary Bubble informs her of a forthcoming visit by pencil slim Penny Caspar-Morse,who once teased her about her weight. She is not keen on Saffy's idea that she takes exercise,the doctor will not give her slimming pills and,after a nightmare,decides against Patsy's suggestion of liposuction. However,when Penny arrives,it seems she has been temporarily blinded,so Eddy will get away with it - or will she? Despite their frequent conflicts Eddy feels lost when Saffy moves out to live in college and drinks herself unconscious. When she wakes up she finds Patsy and her colleagues in her kitchen as their magazine has gone bust and Patsy is considering a move to New York for another job offer. Despite the inevitable set-to between Patsy and Saffy when the latter returns for her things, Eddy ends up arguing with Patsy for abandoning her and decides to sell the house. When Saffy hires a handsome young man to do the Monsoons' garden Patsy recognizes him as Jago Balfour,younger brother of a friend of hers,who died of a drug overdose,leaving Jago the family mansion and its grounds. Gold-digging Eddy wastes no time in trying to seduce Jago,only to learn that he had to get rid of his estates to pay the death duties and sold them to rock singer Roger Daltrey to turn into a fish farm. Eddy and Patsy are off to France but find themselves staying,not in the expected chateau but a tiny cottage where they feel threatened by an old Frenchman whose language they cannot understand. When Saffy and Bubble arrive,usual air-head Bubble surprises with her perfect French,explaining that he was inviting them to move into the chateau further up the road. A pleasant holiday results though on the return home Customs find a white powder in Patsy's luggage,which turns out to be perfectly harmless - to her annoyance. Bubble is now Eddy's maid and Bo and Marshall are running a Christian television station. They inadvertently let Eddy know that her long-lost son Serge is gay and living in New York so,with Patsy,who is heading there for the fashion week,she ends up in the Big Apple. After a visit to GUFF,a gay drop-in centre,they locate Serge but have to pretend to be Lesbians and undergo a civil wedding for their information. However Eddy is disappointed to find that,like Saffy,Serge is a shy,bookish type though she hits it off with his extrovert boyfriend Martin. The quartet 'do' fashion week and visit a bar,which Patsy burns down after dancing on the counter,leading to their arrest. Returning to London Eddy makes up with Saffy but tells her that she has disowned Serge and adopted Martin instead. Eddy and patsy are about to go out for a New year party when Patsy's older sister Jackie arrives,claiming to be homeless and asking to stay at Eddy's until she can get the money together to start a shelter for stray animals. patsy raids Eddy's belongings in order to get things that Jackie can sell to raise money but,by the time she has finished and shown Jackie out,it is too late to go to the party. Eddy is in hospital with a sore foot and Patsy has booked in for facial surgery in readiness for a gossip magazine interview about a recent indiscretion. They are both very demanding patients. Whilst under anaesthetic Eddy dreams she is dying and surrounded by a glamorous version of her real family. When she wakes up she finds the pain was caused by an acupuncture needle which went astray whilst Patsy's treatment is a disaster. Following a promotion for Prince Charles' biscuits Eddy becomes obsessed with the high life and pays thirty thousand pounds for a weekend at a country house for herself and Patsy,though they soon get bored as there is nothing glamorous to do. They decide to go shooting and bag a pheasant but it is still alive and Eddy does not have the heart to kill it so she releases it in Hyde Park. Saffy's college friend Sarah,meanwhile,becomes obsessed with Emma Bunton after they attend Saffy's baby shower and has to be restrained from stalking her. Eddy feels redundant when Bubble takes over the running of the office and asks Saffy if she can come to her college Open Day presentation. When Saffy at first refuses Eddy threatens to adopt a Romanian baby and rings the adoption agency but forgets to cancel the deal after Saffy has relented. Consequently the Open Day is inundated by women offering babies to Eddy. Or was it all a dream she had whilst in her isolation tank? Fresh out of prison after serving two years for (innocently) providing asylum seekers with false passports Saffy is unusually garlanded as a heroine by Patsy. Until Saffy brings her cell-mate Baron to stay and it turns out that Baron is Patsy's old drug dealer, to whom she owes ï¿½50,000 and Baron will not leave until she gets it. Fortunately there is a way out, though it means that Patsy will have to face up to being a pensioner and not thirty-nine, as she has claimed for so long. At a dinner to award the prize to the best P.R. consultant Eddy is not happy when she loses out to rival Claudia Bing,despite having bribed the judging panel,though Bubble pairs up with Claudia's male assistant,Squeak. On returning home Eddy finds Saffy in an amorous situation with Gerard,her tutor,though on discovery that he is married Eddy hits him. At a P.R. meeting Claudia scoffs at Eddy,who has lost her speech,which has been thrown out with the trash. in their efforts to regain it Eddy and Patsy end up on a refuge barge. After Saffy berates her for being lazy and useless Eddy decides to impress her by representing her daughter's favourite French film star,screen legend Jeanne Durand and booking the Albert Hall for Jeanne to give a concert. Unfortunately Jeanne either cannot or will not sing and Bubble has to be brought on board to save the day. Mother and daughter harmony is restored,though the future looks bleak for Jeanne's Carnegie Hall debut. Patsy has moved in with the Monsoons whilst her flat is being fumigated and Saffy does not find her a welcome guest though Patsy herself is jealous when Eddy gets a date. Patsy finally goes to work but needs a map to find the office where she edits her magazine and on arrival alienates all her models. So she comes up with a plan to give Saffy and Mother make-overs on television but,since Saffy is her natural enemy,she has to win over her with a sob-story about how she was neglected by her own mother,never knew her father and relied on Eddy's mother to give her those little humanising qualities. After Bubble,who gets sacked as a result, accidentally sends most of Eddy's clients' details to rival Claudia Bing,Claudia poaches them - including Twiggy,who is annoyed because Mother,confusing her with Madonna,has been stalking her. Eventually,through the unlikely intervention of Katy Grin,Eddy ends up back in business but in the meantime is encouraged by Saffy to attend Menopausal Anonymous with Patsy after the latter has been diagnosed with osteoporosis. Eddy is rude and disruptive of course. After the group has dispersed Saffy has a weird dream in which Patsy announces that she is pregnant with Mick Jagger's sperm,which she bought at an auction. Patsy and Eddy go to Marrakesh in Morocco,accompanied by Saffy,who is on a college project,staying with lecherous 'Uncle' Humphrey,whose advances Saffy rejects. After Eddy has revealed that Patsy once had an unsuccessful sex change here they get robbed and Patsy sells Saffy to white slavers for money. The two older women travel into the desert for the shoot,meeting Saffy whom Eddy convinces they were looking for. Back at the villa Patsy and Eddy get stoned whilst Saffy has a sexual adventure with Humphrey's young local servant. Eddy is preparing to host old friend Bettina,a notorious minimalist,and her husband Max, and clears everything out of the house,including Saffy. Patsy is also excluded but when the couple turn up,with their new baby,they fill the house with clutter,annoying Eddy who leaves them and goes into town. When she sees Patsy in a restaurant she cajoles celebrities into pretending they are her friends so Patsy will be jealous but,after Eddy has slept with Max and he and his wife left in a huff,order is restored between the two friends. Returning from Africa, where she spends half the year with her husband and daughter, Saffy finds that Edina has let the house to film star Michael Douglas for the Olympic Games but has forgotten when they start. Eddy and Patsy - who now needs incontinence pants - doll themselves up for their guest but instead find themselves hosting Marshall,to whom Michael gave his tickets when they met at a sex addiction group,and Bo. However when Marshall drops his tickets for the pre-Olympic party they use them to gate-crash,their gaucherie inevitably getting them thrown out,though they do get to use the stadium. Back home they settle down to watch the games on television with Bubble,Saffy and Mother - who knows something the rest of them do not. Eddy has installed a panic room in the house in case of burglars but she panics herself when Patsy brings home a demanding Minnie Driver whom she is hoping to dress in a collection of designer clothes and become her stylist. After Patsy wrestles Eddy for a necklace Minnie wants they fall into the panic room and manage to get themselves locked in whilst Minnie makes off with the clothes. After playing Trivial Pursuit with Saffy through the video camera they get out and are surprised to learn they have only been shut in for a short while and not for days. Eddy is due to appear on the Richard and Judy morning chat show and Patsy has just the thing to get rid of her wrinkles - Parallox,a Do-It-Yourself Botox treatment. Whilst Eddy is asleep Patsy injects her face with it but rather overdoes it so that next morning she is paralysed above the neck and has to watch Katy Grin,Bubble's smug cousin,being interviewed in her absence. This is bad news too for Saffy who nearly gets a job working for New Labour until the interviewer decides she should stay at home and feed her invalid mother. Patsy gets the chance to relive her days as a model on a photo shoot in Paris with top model Erin O'Connor and Eddy comes along for a mother-and -daughter fashion spread. Since she fails to persuade any glamorous actress to play the daughter Saffy has to do instead but,whilst Patsy gets edged out of the picture by younger models and a demanding photographer Eddy and Saffy,amazingly enough,get on very well. Until Eddy persuades Saffy to do something out of character on top of the Eiffel tower. In an effort to get Eddy to economise Saffy conspires with the family accountant to lead her to believe she is poor,so she instantly buys a smaller car - an expensive Alpha Romeo. Supermarket shopping for the first time with Patsy she gets tired of waiting and steals a crate of champagne and is later arrested for drunk driving. She and Patsy are arrested and taken to court where they are sentenced to community service in an old people's home. Eddy is dating Pete,who was a recording engineer at Abbey Road and has some previously unreleased tapes of the Beatles. Eddy gives a party to showcase them - insulting Elton John at the same time - but the result is a disappointment since Patsy accidentally pressed the recording button whilst in the studio so that the Beatles' tracks have been completely wiped and instead all that can be heard is Eddy singing along to them,recorded over them. Eddy has not had sex in an age and Patsy decides to remedy the situation by holding an orgy with male escorts but they are not especially enthusiastic so,to get them going,Patsy plays a video of an orgy she and Eddy attended in their youth. Unfortunately it turns out to be the video Saffy had made for her science presentation at the university so Eddy and Patsy rush off to try and prevent her from showing the orgy tape,which has accidentally been switched. They are too late but the film shows that,even when young,Eddy had little appetite for sex and fell asleep with a packet of crisps. Encouraged by Taylor Saffy finishes writing her play,'Self-Raising Flower',about her oppressive life with Patsy and Eddy,who do not share the rest of the family's enthusiasm to attend the opening night. Indeed Eddy unsuccessfully tries to get it banned. However she and Patsy cannot resist turning up at the last minute. The play,with Patsy portrayed by a man,is a roaring success but only because people mistakenly believe it to be a comedy and Eddy and Patsy become celebrities as a result. Saffy also gains an admirer in Kasha,the actress playing her on stage. Eddy is living in a commune but failing to fit in,whilst Mother has moved into her empty house and is buying things from the shopping channel with Eddy's credit card. Patsy is having artistic difficulties in New York and sets out to sleep with the publisher but he is elderly and infirm and dies after marrying Bo,Marshall's girlfriend,now his nurse. Whilst Patsy is drinking alone on a roof-top Eddy turns up in a helicopter and they return home. A flash forward twenty five years shows Saffy as a housewife and mother whilst Eddy and Patsy are growing old disgracefully - of course. Whilst Paolo,Saffy's sexy but self-centred boyfriend,proposes to her, Eddy and Patsy go on a skiing holiday where they row over the lack of glamorous facilities and their constant dependency on each other - even in a past life they were conjoined twins in a circus. Eddy goes skiing and has a near death experience but God appears to her and tells her that it is not yet her time. Meanwhile Mother goes to the airport with a sign to welcome her visiting friends -'It's Me,Dears' - but in her confusion gets mistaken for a terrorist and is rescued by Bo in a burkha. Mother's very hip friends turn up and stay in a camper van in the street but extract electricity from the house. Eddy is unusually supportive of Saffy as the wedding draws near,largely because Paolo's parents are extremely wealthy. When Kalishia,the groom's mother,turns her nose up at Saffy as being not good enough for her son,Patsy changes her mind for her by reminding her that they were once co-stars in a porn film. However,just as the bride and groom are about to exchange vows Eddy has another vision of God,who indicates that the marriage should not take place,and so she calls it off. After Paolo has gone off with the bridesmaid Eddy and Patsy console Saffy but still use her honeymoon trip airline tickets for their own holiday. Max and Bettina reappear,now divorced as Max is gay and Bettina has reverted to being a minimalist. She designs a kitchen for Eddy which is so minimal that it is little more than a white box,with even the stairs removed and even Eddy hates it. After she and Patsy pay a visit to designer Terence Conran and his American colleague Kunz,Eddy recalls that she saw her dream kitchen in a previous life and brings in medium Crystalline to regress her so that she can get its details. Saffy returns with Jane but no John as she found out at their African wedding that he had other wives. She does not take kindly to the disruption and,since the house is in her name,evicts Eddy and Patsy who end up camping out in Terence Conran's shop window. Absurd Fights is a web series all about comedic, yet incredible, fight scenes. Each episode delivers a new location with two opponents pitted against each other: one with conventional weapons, and the other with something absurd such as toys, duct tape, or appliances. What ensues is a strangely practical fighting use for the absurd weapons. Started as a summer substitution program for the "Chevrolet on Broadway" series. This program, produced by Amherst dramatics professor Curtis Canfield featured relative unknowns performing in thirty-minute stage productions of works by such well-known authors and playwrights as Thornton Wilder and Robert Finch.

The H.E.A.T. team is sent to Rio de Janeiro to protect an ambassador from assassination. They manage to deflect the attack but the perpetrator escapes and subsequently develops plans to disrupt an anti-terrorist conference held on the H.E.A.T. team's own turf.

While the team pursues a gang of gunrunners, a British policeman chases Cat for a burglary she committed before she joined the H.E.A.T. team. Cat, Krissie, Marcos and Tommy are marooned on an island when their boat floats free from it's anchorage. While Mike and Ashley search for them when they fail to report back to work, the foursome's situation becomes desperate when Krissie is bitten by a poisonous spider and a crazed ex-Vietnam soldier hiding on the island thinks Tommy is the man responsible for the loss of the old soldier's platoon twenty-five years earlier. The Acapulco H.E.A.T. team is sent to Columbia to thwart the assassination of a judge leading an investigation into the activities of Suarez, a reputed drug lord. The woman leading the team of killers is a turncoat MI-6 agent and an old rival of Ashley's. Five years after their last mission (see _"Acapulco H.E.A.T." (1993)_ (qv)), the two remaining members of the original H.E.A.T. team join a mysterious French woman and a dizzy computer whiz as for-hire undercover agents. Patrick Malone and Gregg Miles were Korean-war buddies who "retired" to a life as beachcombers in Acapulco. When they weren't lounging around or chasing women, they worked as bodyguards for Mr. Carver.

Haruyuki and Takumu set out for their final showdown with Nomi. Chiyuri wishes to join them, and they agree to let her come along. But a sudden ambush by an unknown Burst Linker traps Silver Crow, leaving Cyan Pile to take on Dusk Taker alone. Haruyuki suspects that Cyan Pile is challenging Kuroyukihime within Accel World via access through Chiyuri's neuro-linker.

The viewer sees interviews with a survivor and with a rescue pilot, and learns of the efforts of veterans to have a memorial built. Next is a story on the Sandhill Crane, a bird that makes an annual autumn visit to Indiana. "Midwest Moment" introduces the viewer to the bottle collector, Arty McBride. Michael Atwood, the host, interviews Martin Krause, the curator of the Indianapolis Museum of Art, on the 19th-century Hoosier painters who studied in Germany. Finally, the viewer visits a small town that can't make up its mind: the road sign says "Carrollton or Finly." It turns out the town also has three additional names, including one memorialized by James Whitcomb Riley in his poem, "The Little Town o' Tailholt." "Across Indiana" introduces the viewer to Joe Kremp, a WWII enthusiast, who collects and restores such relics such as an advanced Navy trainer plane (an SNJ-5) and an anti-aircraft gun.

"Midwest Moment" introduces Judy Rice and her socially conscious sculpture of a Holstein cow. Finally, the viewer visits Martinsville and meets a member of a dying breed: the milkman. "Across Indiana" takes us to the Indiana Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument in Indianapolis and tells us the story of its current restoration, which is funded by selling steps of the staircase leading to the observation deck. Hoosier celebrities, such as 'Red Skelton' (qv), 'Michael Jackson (I)' (qv), 'John Mellencamp' (qv), 'David Letterman' (qv), 'Dave Thomas (VII)' (qv) of Wendy's restaurants fame, and Orville Redenbacher bought steps, each of which has a commemorative plaque; and so have ordinary folks, such as Leo Kriner, who bought one for his stone carver father, and the Koch family, for their daughter, Colleen T. Koch (Jan. 10 1962-August 23, 1965), who died of cancer. The host, 'Michael Atwood (I)' (qv), interviews Harry L. Rinker, an antiques dealer who edits "Warman's Antiques and Their Prices".

Finally, the host, Michael Atwood, looks at Hoosier prairies and the Shiloh Cemetery. November 22, 1963 - A motorcade rounds a corner - a muzzle flashes into history and nothing will ever be the same. Not for Ben Ford, not for anyone. Camelot is dead. On that fateful day, Ben's love, Katie, disappears after a flight from Dallas. From quiet, industrious Windsor to the decaying giant, Detroit, he searches for answers that draw him deeper into a world of deceit and violence. A world that reflects his inner turmoil; "Who killed Katie?" Forty years later, the remains of two bodies are found. Ben is a broken old man with a grown daughter he barely knows. The police are at his door. He is the prime suspect in Katie's murder. Only he knows the truth and is willing to take it to his grave but the specter of his past finds new life, threatening to destroy his daughter and her family. The events of his life unfold in back alleys and bars, crossing the paths of ruthless mobsters and helpless victims. In his search for justice, Ben is swept into a conspiracy that shaped the modern world. The ashes of his youth are scattered across the river to Motor City. History's not done yet. Not with Ben, his family, any of us. Whether it's November 1963 or today - the river of history can always change course. Whether you go with the current - or get pulled under - that's a lesson for a lifetime.
null November 22, 1963 is the day Ben Ford turns thirty. He's about to ask his stewardess girlfriend Katie to marry him, leave his job as an insurance investigator and begin a new life. Then, on that fateful day, a motorcade rounds a corner - a muzzle flash passes into history - the President is shot and Camelot is dead. Katie's flight is diverted through Dallas - and she disappears. Nothing will ever be the same. Not for Ben. Not for Katie. Not for any of us. Forty years later, Ben Ford is a bitter old man in ill health, forced to live with a grown daughter he barely knows. At the heart of their troubled relationship is a secret he'll do anything to keep; a secret she'll risk everything to learn. When Katie's body washes ashore, the police are at his door, accusing him of murder. Ben Ford's investigation in the 1960's leads him to the one living stewardess left aboard Katie's flight, while shady mob dealings begin to unravel. A present-day and much older Benjamin Ford does not recognize the Windsor/Detroit of his youth and is forced to move in with his daughter, Kathleen Ford McNeal, and her family. Eight months after Katie's 1963 death, Ben Ford faces mounting pressures to stop his investigation into Katie's disappearance, while territorial disputes flare up between Windsor/Detroit area mobsters. Fast tracking into the future, Benjamin Ford's daughter Kathleen joins the police investigation from the American side, while her father adjusts to unfamiliar surroundings. Ben Ford's investigation into a distasteful divorce case leads him to mobster Frank Calasso's speakeasy. It seems they may have crossed paths before. Four decades later, Ben is put behind bars after confessing to Katie's murder. Kathleen is sure that her father is lying to protect her but can't figure out why. Gio loves his beautiful, talented and sexy wife Claire. Claire, a professionally trained actress, is making head way in Los Angeles through any role she can get, a concept lost on Gio who believes that with training it shouldn't be hard. His sometimes errant remarks about the industry have caused friction with Claire and have led him straight to Act-Anon's doors. Gio loves his beautiful, talented and sexy wife Claire. Claire, a professionally trained actress, is making head way in Los Angeles through any role she can get, a concept lost on Gio who believes that with training it shouldn't be hard. His sometimes errant remarks about the industry have caused friction with Claire and have led him straight to Act-Anon's doors. Albert's mother is an actress, his grandmother is an actress and surprise... his fiancï¿½ Marcus happens to be an actor. No stranger to the Act-Anon rooms- Albert is working on serenity in love especially when unbeknownst to him he pushes his partner's ultra sensitive "actor" buttons. Hope loves Rob. Rob loves Hope...and musical theatre. They are trying to make a baby. With Rob's singing and Hope's desperation to conceive, tensions in the house are rising. But with a spirit that underlies her name and a love for Act-Anon and the steps of her program she is able to make the most of her situation with love, humor and yes a little bit of...(wink wink) in the bedroom. Marnie is an Alabama native who moved to Los Angeles with her teenage daughter Natalie for pilot season. She doesn't even know what pilot season is, other than it's important to her young actress daughter, Natalie. As she navigates the newness of Act-Anon and her allergies she begins to discover some sense of security- from Natalie's actor mood swings. Nadia is a successful pediatrician who was overshadowed by her younger sister Lil. She doesn't "do" emotions. Lil "does" emotions, in other words she bakes them on high for 20 minutes in the microwave. Only this time it isn't a baked potato exploding- it's Nadia. The sudden rush of emotions leaves Nadia at a stand still and she turns to Act-Anon to make sense of her sudden outbursts. 'Michael Caine (I)' (qv) teaches the art of movie acting to five young actors, who perform scenes from _Alfie (1966)_ (qv), _Deathtrap (1982)_ (qv) and _Educating Rita (1983)_ (qv). He talks about how to perform in close-ups and extreme close-ups. He warns about the continuity dangers of smoking cigarettes or fiddling with props. He talks about screen tests, special effects men who are cavalier about your safety and speaking to someone who is off camera. The movie camera is your best friend and most attentive lover, he says, even though you invariably ignore her. The art of movie acting can be summed up in one word: relax! A series of fifteen-minute films sponsored by Bell & Howell Cameras to demonstrate to viewers the power of film to bring people into places and situations they would never have seen before. Different episodes went to exciting travel spots, while others provided a look at unusual or entertaining events, while still others gave a glimpse of little-seen occupations. It is the new millennium. Digital war is outlawed. In Asia are matches between large small Robots called Mecha toys. These Action Figures take place between two large powerful over disputed homelands at John's house and for this reason he gonna animate them for win the battle. But many heroes are coming too. The main character Gundam is a Japanese Robot and the others toys are the Transformers from US and all action toys from Anime and Videogames. The show follows four superheroes, who are action figures, on stopping evil. There is The Flesh, who is "Super strong and super naked," ThunderGirl, who has the ability to fly, Stinky Diver, who usually swims in toilets, and Meltman, whose only power is to melt, making him the smallest and weakest of the team. Alex Mann is a top competitor for the Acceleration Games, a worldwide extreme sports competition tour. During a deadly accident, he discovers his special ability called the AMP Factor, which is the ability, in extremely dangerous situations, to suddenly be able to examine his surroundings and computate mathematically the best possible action. This makes him capable of performing complex and daring stunts to save the day that are normally impossible. This discovery vastly complicates his and his support team's lives as they find themselves facing villians like Dr. X, who want to exploit Alex's power to his own end. In Hollywood you're only as good as your last flick, and Dragonfire Films exec Peter Dragon has hit bottom with his $150 million bomb "Slow Torture." His only hope to get back to the way things were is the shoot-'em-up film "Beverly Hills Gun Club," and the only person that will help him is ex-child star turned hooker Wendy Ward. On Monday, Bobby G. tells Peter to raise $50 million before Friday or he won't back the "Beverly Hills Gunclub". Adam is facing major revisions to his script but gets writer's block. So, Wendy promises him a night to remember to encourage him. Jane, Peter's ex, tells him that an unexpected bout of love-making between them resulted in a pregnancy, and that her current husband Bobby G. is ecstatic to finally get an heir. Sandra Bullock bursts into Peter Dragon's office having discovered that he is selling a sex tape secretly filmed while they were dating on his website. Adam Rafkin is in hospital suffering from a serious case of exhaustion and Peter's star Cole Riccardi visits him in the middle of the night to tell him he wants to come out of the closet. After being declared dead, Peter makes a miraculous recovery from his heart attack and starts going to baby class with his ex, Jane. Holden Van Dorn calls in the middle of the night to say director Titus Scroad is floating face up in his pool. Peter Dragon finds no bankable director will commit to Beverly Hills Gunclub until he meets with the reclusive Titus Scroad. He also has to entertain his daughter Georgia for the duration of "Take Your Daughter to Work Day" and almost loses her to Momo Shabongs father, the King. It's the first day of shooting and naturally nothing goes right, leading to heart troubles for Peter Dragon. Holden is unhappy with the size of his codpiece and the fact his character wears a watch. Reagan is insecure and doesn't want anyone to look at her while she acts and a feud between Stuart and Jenny results in Holden getting drunk. Peter Dragon mouths off during a Washington court hearing, so Bobby G. forces him to hire crafty publicist Connie Hunt to work on his image. Meanwhile slick agent Marty Jordan dazzles Adam Rafkin and makes him part with his agent of ten years Stuart is considering a job offer to become head of comedy for UPN. Reagan is being difficult while shooting a sex scene for Beverly Hills Gun Club. Adam wants to get paid for all of his rewrites, but Peter talks him into accepting a producers credit instead. On his way to the premiere of his latest action movie, "Slow Torture", producer Peter Dragon accidentally picks up a hooker, Wendy Ward. Afterwards it becomes clear that the film is a disaster and Wendy is the only one who honestly tells Peter what's wrong with it. So, he takes her in and asks her to read a pile of scripts he has just purchased. She picks out the only good one: "Beverly Hills Gunclub". Dragonfire's Christmas action extravaganza "Slow Torture" has tanked at the box office, leaving Peter to set his last hopes on the newly discovered script "Beverly Hills Gunclub". He hires the hooker who pointed this script out to him, Wendy Ward, and makes her vice president of production. A rumor about Peter Dragon ending up in hospital with a frog in his behind spreads like wildfire. Meanwhile, a blissfully unaware Peter picks up Jenny Johnson at a party and makes her Wendy's assistant. But then his ex wife, Jane, has a falling out with Bobby G and wants to return to Dragon. After hiring the last available director on the list, Guy Rennolds and inadvertently investing his own money into Beverly Hills Gun Club, Peter is more adamant to finish the picture than ever. Just then it turns out the Rothstein brothers bought Adam Rafkin's script under a different title a year earlier and as such own the rights to the film. Actor 5: Is Acting Right For You?

Actress Laurel Harris Delights ActorsE Chat Audiences, interviewed by host Kurt Kelly who has been a mogul in the journalism, voice over, actor, reporter, host, producer, director and broadcasting world for 30 years. "The Voice of Experience" is a sought after resource that leads to engaging and amazing content with every interview. Laurel Harris stopped by ActorsE Chat with host Kurt Kelly to discuss her acting career and working with some of the most amazing talents in the industry. Laurel started off dancing and lighting up the stage before becoming an actor. She was even a founding member of the Ormao Dance Company. She caught the bug for the stage when she was in high school and attended a performing arts college for her freshman year of college. Then Laurel pursued a Theater degree at Whitworth College in Spokane, Washington. During this time Laurel was also going back and forth to LA for her job and also for training. Laurel then headed to Colorado to finish her BA which had an emphasis in Film and Television. She was determined to make her way in the industry but did not feel ready to move forward with acting full time, Laurel instead plied her trade as a producer. She took a position as a DJ at a radio station in Colorado called KKLI. Shortly thereafter, she found herself offered her first television job as she was hosting and producing a morning show on "The Vacation Channel" in Vail, Colorado. Laurel found her calling then in front of the camera and stayed employed full time in acting with hosting and voice over work. Laurel then took a bigger job as the lead host of the national, live game show called "Bingo TV" for Dish Network. She learned how to budget and to plan to use all of her talents to continually grow her career into new areas. She also maintained her role as a producer and she continued working on projects that were close to her heart. She enjoyed working with Peacejam in which she produced a documentary series in which she interviewed Nobel Peace Laureates from around the world and she tracked all of the projects they were doing with local kids and the impact being made on their lives. Laurel also won many different Telly's, NATOA's and a regional Emmy for her production work. Laurel decided to go back to acting full time because it is her true first love but she still does print work as well as other voice over work. Laurel's range has continued to grow as well as she has continued to take on other genres such as comedy and serious dramatic roles. Laurel has a face and charming smile that translates across Medias as well as across all kinds of formats. Laurel has directed, produced, and starred in many movies over the past few years. In 2013 alone she starred 4 major productions. Two of these were feature films, one was a television documentary and the other was a made for television movie. The first of these was Odd Thomas which was based on the book written by Dean Koontz. The movie was the story of a line cook with psychic abilities who had to battle many dark forces in order to save the world. Laurel starred with William Dafoe and really enjoyed working with him, learning from his craft and experience. Laurel was also a part of the Legacy of the Tengu which was the story of a magic sword in Japan which gave its owner immortality but at a high price. The sword was given to Asura who had to live throughout time fulfilling his responsibilities to the world as a defender of the world against darkness. In the most recent incarnation Asura is in fact a police officer trying to blend into a thriving metropolis. Laurel played the role of a police officer. In addition to these Laurel also was in Saige Paints the Sky which is an American Girls film. The American Girls collection has been delighting girls since the 1980s with their dolls and their movies and has become a tradition of American childhood. In their most recent made for television movie, Saige returns to school ready to learn and to be a part of the New Year. Yet she finds out that her favorite art class has been canceled due to budget cuts and she decides to find a way to single-handedly reinstate the art program. Laurel also starred in Creep which is a venture into the mind of A.J. Nelson, the infamous director and his movie "The Creeping Terror". This is the ultimate exploration in documentary into the mental recesses of the director's mind. Laurel's talent and lovely smile will be delighting audiences in every genre with wit and acting skills. Whether she is on the stage as a dancer, behind the camera as a producer, or in front of the camera as a host, hers is a talent that cannot be denied.

In the Series Premiere of Actors Untitled, Marisa and Danny take a reality gig in the hopes of finally breaking into the industry, but three months later they are still struggling. Danny finds an audition that he thinks could jump-start his and Marisa's careers, but the results are not what they expected. Initially created as a summer news program, this show gave viewers an in-depth look at issues that were facing America and the world. Using a combination of rebroadcast news programs and specially produced documentaries, reports were typically given by veteran news anchors, but also occasionally by well-known actors. The program went off the air after its first summer, but returned in 1965 and lasted for another three years. Edwardian adventurer Adam Adamant is frozen alive in a block of ice by his arch-nemesis The Face in 1902 ; in 1966 workmen discover him and he is revived, perfectly preserved... but completely bewildered by his new environment, "swinging 60's" London, until he meets up with the beautiful Georgina Jones, who helps him adapt - and before long, he is back to adventuring, solving crime & fighting evil wherever it may lurk... In 1902, Adam Adamant is lured into a trap by his arch nemesis 'The Face' and frozen in ice for eternity. That is until he is accidentally freed by workmen in 1966. Bewildered to find himself in the Swinging Sixties, Adamant is taken in by mod girl and lifelong fan Georgina Jones. When Georgie's grandfather is killed by a couple of thugs, Adamant decides his services are once again needed. A deadly virus has been discovered by accident and naturally it is almost immediately stolen. Adamants only clue requires him to witness the tail end of a beauty contest won by none other than Georgina Jones. Sinoda, owner of the Cafï¿½ Val Deum and organizer of the monthly contest offers Georgie a chance to build the world anew after the virus cleanses it of ugliness. The Bank of England wants Adamant to dispute the identity of Grand Duchess Vorokhov (so they don't have to pay her) but Adam is more interested in a brooch the elderly woman wears. As he visits Mede Hall House, he is unaware an old enemy is lying there, waiting.... Adam is drafted back into the 51st Yeomandry, having never officially been discharged, on a special mission. Bearing the rank of Colonel since 1895, his seniority outranks current Colonel Mannering, who has come up with a scheme to stop the proposed disbanding of his unit. Adamant rescues Georgie from two motorcyclists who were chasing her because of a stick of rock candy. Inside they find a incomprehensible diagram which leads them to Blackpool to investigate. When Punch and Judy man William E. Simms overhears the villains plotting to kill Adamant, he decides to intervene. Georgie's afternoon bottled party turns into a group bank robbery followed by amnesia for all concerned. After posting bail for Miss Jones, Adam Adamant investigates the cause of the subliminal criminal instructions: a single record produced by Hypersonic. Lord Pearmains exclusive parties routinely end with sacrificial ceremonies and lead to blackmail of high ranking government employees. When Adamant investigates and Georgina takes a job as a domestic at Pearmain Hall, both end up in danger of being the next victim. Benjamin Kinthly steals a secret formula with the intention of making the entire UK addicted to the smell of his washing detergent 'Cloud 7'. Even Georgie and Simms become infatuated, leaving it to Adam Adamant to find the antidote before it's too late. The conveniently-timed deaths of a number of rich businessmen appear to have taken place shortly before they were due to receive large tax demands, arousing the suspicions of the Inland Revenue. The only common factor seems to have been their psychiatrist; Adam Adamant, posing as a harassed financier, makes an appointment with the man, who concludes from his patient's unusual mental history that he is suffering severe delusions and takes the opportunity to prescribe a stay at a sinister health resort. The Italian Vice Consul's wife drops dead in Adam Adamant's arms, leading him to investigate a string of similar deaths. It soon transpires her dress was bugged and booby-trapped by fashion designer Roger Clair. But by the time Adam learns this, Georgina is already wearing one of Roger's creations. Richman continues his sandwich-eating quest on the west coast of California. Featured sandwiches include: a Memphis-style 15-spice-rubbed pulled pork sandwich topped with a maple syrup-and-pineapple-sweetened coleslaw, plus piping hot barbecue sauce, all inside a grilled Brioche bun at JR's Barbeque in Los Angeles, California; the "El Toro", a sandwich of Mesquite-grilled tri-tip beef, double-grilled and doused in a sweet barbecue sauce while placed inside a fresh-baked Kaiser roll, at Phil's BBQ in San Diego, California; and a "pulled" lamb sandwich topped with pickled watermelon rind, placed inside a sweet deli roll and served with a side of red cabbage slaw and a unique watermelon vinegar sauce from Wexler's in San Francisco, California. In the premiere episode, Adam Richman travels to Daytona, FL to join 200,000 passionate NASCAR fans in the legendary infield for the 55th running of the Daytona 500 to experience their ingenious tailgating and culinary creations first-hand. Adam Anthony's world is turned upside down when his girlfriend dumps him - landing him on the couch of his new friend Jamero, his first ever African American friend. Displaced with nowhere else to go, Adam finds himself navigating through Jamero's unfamiliar and very colorful world. Inspired by the unforgettable Odd Couple sitcom, Adam & Jamero updates the classic with white and black lead actors. Through humor, Adam & Jamero turn assumptions and generalizations on their head. As the show unfolds, characters begin to understand the imperfections we all have in common. Adam, now living with Jamero, opens the door one morning to a beautiful woman named Jade - Jamero's childhood friend. Their introduction is less than amicable as she ridicules Adam for his surprise cleaning spree and for being a one hit pop sell out. Adam arrives at Jamero's house for the first time only to discover he's a hoarder. Adam, who suffers from acute OCD, is grossed out by Jamero's home but has nowhere else to go. When Jamero asks about his girlfriend, Adam breaks down crying and confesses he was dumped and has been sleeping on the couch. A TV adaptation of the Tracy/Hepburn classic. Adam Bonner was a young assistant DA while his wife, Amanda, was a junior partner in a law firm. Their jobs often put them in conflict within the courtroom and, by extension, at home. Amanda (and the series) was also a crusader for women's rights. A realistic police drama following the lives of two officers of the LAPD, veteran Pete Malloy and his rookie partner, Jim Reed. Done in a spare, almost "docudrama" style, each episode covered a variety of incidents that the officers encountered during a shift, from the tragic to the trivial. Malloy has won $10,000 in a woman's shampoo naming contest and is being bombarded with mail at work and suggestions from Reed on how to invest the money but Malloy wants a new boat. Opening call is a loud noise complaint from an elderly gentleman about a new elderly female tenant and her Irish music. Malloy and Reed explain the complaint and introduce the couple to each other and quietly leave them together. While on patrol a sniper starts shooting and they call in support resulting in them shooting the sniper in a car while fleeing. A theft report call is a man in an expensive home that appears to have been stripped. In fact due to his financial ruin and three wives the only items left were two cameras and a TV that were stolen. A call about body in alley is a wino killed for his new tennis shoes. As they leave the scene the officers spot another wino wearing new tennis shoes sleeping it off in a junked car. Malloy realizing Reed has his best interests at heart presents Reed with a gift of a single share of stock worth $5 to develop a "nest egg". Reed and Malloy spend most of their time in the countryside surrounding Los Angeles. Among their more mundane tasks is to stop an erratic driver under the influence of drugs and alcohol. However, the bigger catch is alerted to them by Teri, a girl on horseback, who saw a light plane land in secluded field. Reed and Malloy investigate to see the plane and a departing jeep off in the distance. When they arrive just in time as the plane is about to take off, they flag the plane to a halt. The rented plane is piloted by Paul Stocker, a cocky but "clean" individual who had all the right answers as to why he landed in the field. Although they know he was up to no good, they have nothing to hold him on so let him go. They later learn from Sgt. Marco and Det. Edwards of the DEA that this scenario has all the hallmarks of a new Mexican drug smuggling ring, the use of the rented plane a device to feign ignorance by the pilot if anything is found on the plane itself. Thus the only way to stop the smugglers is to catch them in the act of transferring the actual drugs at the drop offs. Luckily a few days later, Reed and Malloy have a chance encounter with Stocker. From that encounter, they run a check on some license plates which leads them to the jeep; the DEA officials now can tail the jeep for whenever the next drop is to take place. Reed and Malloy ask to be there when the bust is made just to see the smug look on Stocker's face wiped off. The officers are briefed to be on the lookout for a burglar with a long list of crimes attributed to him. A call about a man who might be the burglar is a friendly drunk at the wrong address who they take in. At the station Mac tells them an Asian woman and her daughter are looking for an old wood stove she gave away not knowing her husband hid his money in it. It was piked up by a yellow truck with one door. They make inquires with the local charities and an antique buyer but with no luck. A call at a phone booth has an obese woman trapped inside who they free with a simple trick. They are called to a stake-out for the burglar and have to go in pursuit of him followed by Reed catching him in a foot chase. During the pursuit Malloy spots the charity truck. They take the woman and daughter to the charity where they recover the money. They end the day with a stop at a bar where Woods is handling the same drunk who has fallen down stairs and injured himself. The pair are sent to transport a prisoner from the Sheriff's office in Malibu back to LA due to traffic warrants. Unknown to everyone he is a witness to a gangland murder and a hit has been ordered on him. Their patrol car has a tire shot out in an ambush and they find themselves isolated in the hills of the area and no radio contact. Reed goes for help but is captured by the hit men. Malloy and their passenger steal the hit man's car and make it to a phone. A helicopter search ensues for the two hit men and Reed. However, Reed is able to overpower them. The officers spot a young boy hiding in the woods at night. He has run away from home and as they take him home they receive a call about a disturbance at his address. When they arrive, his mom and step dad appear quiet but are warned. A call to a parking lot involves a man in a car waiting for his wife. He reports a young girl jumped in his car with money ready to buy pills. They stake out the lot and spot the girl find the correct car. Next call is back to the couple's apartment as Officer Woods tells them he has handled the same call in the past week. The couple is in a throwing match and require time to settle down. They spot a man with a screwdriver trying to break into a pickup truck topper. What looks like a car theft is a man locked out by his dog. A return call to the apartment results in them taking the husband to his sister's apartment. They spot a drunk on a stolen bicycle and take him in. The sister of the husband calls and reports her brother has gone back to their apartment. As they arrive at the couple's apartment, they hear shots. Reed has agreed to buy an anniversary present for Mac but funds are limited. The first call is to bar where an ex-wrestler paralyzed by polio and confined to wheelchair is breaking up the bar. Next stop is a liquor store where they decide to buy a bottle of champagne for Mac and the owner offers a discount on a large bottle but the pair go for a smaller bottle they can afford. The pair notice a car tailing them in an manner that causes them to pull him over as they are afraid of an ambush. However, it is a man who has received several tickets in 24 hours. A call comes about a disturbance at a used car dealership. The owner is trying to take advantage of a Mexican man who is not very fluent in English and signed a sales contract without understanding it. This is followed by a call back to the liquor store where the owner has been robbed and shot. A nearby shop owner thinks he shot the robber. The owner reminds the men to take the champagne he wrapped for Mac. Last call is about a man down in a park who has been shot dead. He is the gunman who shot the liquor store owner. On a prowler report at a non-existent address someone fires multiple rounds at the officers. Next day on a run to a heliport to pick up a blood donor, they are again fired upon. Evidence points to the same shooter both times and reveals that Adam-12 is being targeted by a man known to pass bad checks. Reed's wife receives a call indicating that Reed is the target. A man tries to kill himself with gasoline at a gas station but Malloy stops him using a fire extinguisher. Another nighttime prowler call turns up a wino that Reed comes close to shooting. Malloy drops Reed off at his house when a man walks by, known to Reed, and tells him that his car has broken down. Reed offers to let him use his phone. Malloy notices there is a car like the one the suspect is supposed to be driving down the street as he leaves. Malloy and Reed are called to provide backup to of all people Mac, who happened upon a B&E in progress. Despite it being a good bust, Malloy can't help but rib Mac about it being an easy bust. Mac requests Malloy to be the accompanying officer in transporting the perpetrator, Victor Lamson, back to the station, while Reed secures the crime scene. Both Mac and Malloy's friendly attitude change as they, while driving to the station, hit an elderly pedestrian. Both Mac and Malloy know that the pedestrian came out from between two parked cars into traffic, whereas the three independent witnesses on the street all state that the pedestrian was in the pedestrian crosswalk, thus had the right of way, and that Mac was speeding. Lamson, who knows that Mac and Malloy are telling the truth, will not corroborate their story unless they let him go, which they both refuse. Beyond Traffic investigating, Internal Affairs also does. Mac comes to the realization that he could be in real trouble and lose his job, and that Malloy will also have a rough ride if Mac is found guilty. They have to do some digging to see if the victim, who eventually dies from her injuries, and/or the witnesses have ulterior motives in lying about what they saw. Malloy also believes there may be another witness out there that can and will tell the truth. Meanwhile, Lamson ends up being a victim himself when friends of his realize that because he is in jail, his apartment filled with stolen goods is just ripe for the picking. The shift starts with Officer Charlie Burnside pulling a prank on Officer Albert Porter who seems to take it poorly. Porter, a close friend of Reed's, tells Reed, when asked, that it was not the prank but that he thinks Burnside is badge heavy with people in custody. Reed mentions it to Malloy and they decide to keep an eye on Burnside. First case on shift is a robbery where Malloy spots the thief in a car that won't start around the corner from the store. On backup to a call Burnside is handling Reed sees Burnside rough up a suspect resulting in the man being knocked out. Reed reports the incident but the Captain doesn't proceed with charges when the victim states he was struggling with Burnside. Burnside confronts Reed after duty and warns him to be careful as Burnside has an ace up his sleeve. Burnside gives the excuse Reed is angry about his prank on Porter. Reed and Malloy receive a call about a robbery with two armed men resulting in a foot chase to capture both men. Reed and Malloy suggest to Mac that Burnside may have gotten to the prisoner which turns out to be true resulting in charges against Burnside. Burnside confronts Reed again but in so doing loses the support of the other officers. The officers respond to a potential break-in catching a man leaving the building and finding a young boy inside hiding in a locker. The boy has no record and his single mother says this is his first time in trouble. Malloy decides to give the boy a break and releases him to his mother. On patrol they pull over a taxi driving erratically. They find the driver is being robbed by a passenger and thought he had a gun. While at the station Mac informs them that the young boy has a record under a different name and a man posed as his father. A call about an accident at a parking lot involves a long haired man on a motorcycle being accused by the son of the elderly man he hit of reckless driving. However, the elderly man apologizes to the motorcycle rider for not paying attention forcing the son to apologize. The mother of the young boy reports him missing after investigators talked to her. The officers chase him at a store reporting a robbery thinking he was involved but he wasn't. Malloy is helping take a large number of boys on a police sponsored camping trip when Reed arrives with the mother who has decided to send her son along on the camping trip. Malloy is off on a week long youth camping trip that includes Greg Whitney. The trip does not start well when Greg who is short for his age was told to bunk with the younger campers. He gets into trouble for stealing ice cream followed by a charge by some of the campers he stole a boy's watch. He runs off before one of the counselors finds the watch was misplaced. Greg is found stuck down a hill but okay. He proves his mettle by beating the other boys in a cross country race after the boys were coached by Olympic pole vaulter Bob Seagren. Reed tries to provide Greg's mother with some advice on handling him. While on duty he and Wells take a call from a woman who was attacked by a man who passed out when he found she has a python under her coat. At roll call Mac tells the men that Reno West is making the division look bad due to the high cost of thefts in their area. They take a call from a visiting practical nurse where the 70 year old diabetic has passed out and is being protected by a Doberman. Malloy traps the dog in a room with a long board he uses to close the door to the room via a window. They spot Reno Wet at a gas station and stop to talk to him. He is riding with a female friend in her car and for a change he is brusque with the officers about the police watching him. A theft report is made by a man who had an expensive Chinese jade statue stolen. A call about a domestic disturbance results in the arrest of the husband on an outstanding warrant. The wife claims he abuses her but she appears to be the real abuser. They pick up a burglary attempt in progress and notice the car owned by Reno's friend out front with changed plates. When Officer Wells drives into the middle of the investigation alerting the burglar, Malloy recognizes a possible decoy maneuver and catches Reno West. It's the Christmas season, and Malloy and Reed discuss the differences they have in approaching the holidays, especially in shopping. They deal with a noise complaint against a man named George Atkinson on their first call. They do deal with the complaint as they should, but demonstrate that they do have the Christmas spirit in the follow-up actions on the matter. But Malloy and Reed will have to decide if they will break regulation to help George in a request to assist in a task to help a group of people for who this Christmas will be their last together. Next, they head to a loading dock where two young men just stole a truck to take for a joyride. Beyond the theft, the further problem is that the truck contains radioactive material which could kill them if they tamper with it. Malloy and Reed then come across a man siphoning gas out of vehicle. They will hear the man's unusual story of why he is doing it. Next, a passerby informs them of a liquor store robbery in progress. The robber ends up having an ulterior motive to the proceedings beyond the actual theft. Through much of their shift, Malloy and Reed encounter Sam, a Christmas tree salesman who channels more the spirit of Scrooge than Santa... or does he? On PM watch, Reed and Malloy assist Wells and Brady at a domestic dispute involving an armed husband. They investigate the report of a possible dead body, and later, the robbery of a pawn shop. At the gun range the next day, Reed and Malloy, along with Wells and Brady, among others, practice before their monthly qualification. Later, a cabbie tips them on what he thinks is a burglary in progress. They get a hit on prints taken at the pawn shop the night before and find the suspect working at a car wash. He tries for a clean getaway, but pulls a gun instead and is caught. After nightfall they back up Wells and Brady again, on a prowler call this time, where the homeowner takes a shot at a suspected prowler. Woman reports a pickup truck bumped her car. When she stopped, they stole her purse. On patrol they spot a stopped car with the hood up. Driver says his engine over heated but a stakeout shows him meeting with a counterfeiter. A call about loud noise results in a citizen chewing out the officers. A scuffle at a food drive-in results in the arrest of a man for outstanding warrants. A cruise by the house with noise turns up the pickup and two men who robbed the woman. The officers respond to a call at a market where a woman is held for shoplifting. She claims it is her first attempt and she has no money. When they leave the store she runs to a car claiming the baby inside is hers. At the station she escapes when a disruption in the hall distracts the officer with her. Back on patrol the officers take a call about a break-in at a warehouse. Reed is taken hostage but tricks the man holding him. The police receive a report of a baby stolen by a couple including the shoplifting suspect. A call about a disturbance at an apartment results in the capture of the girl and the manager saying her husband stole his car and has the baby. The girl accuses the manager of making the extortion call for $2,000 for the baby. While on patrol another squad car spots the stolen car. Malloy and Reed intercept the car leading to a foot chase by Reed through a rail yard to capture the man. Officers are out sick with the flu which started with Reed who is back. Reed spots a man with a rifle walking a man in front of him down the street. After a brief shoot out, they determine there is an issue with both men. One is involved in book making. While Reed gives a speeder a ticket, Malloy becomes involved in an argument between a customer and the store owner over the quality of fruit in a store across the street. During the night Reed sees a flash of light in a store. Although they initially find nothing wrong, Reed insists they recheck resulting in the capture a man coming off the roof. They spot a young man that appears to be in trouble but Reed loses him in a foot chase. Mac asks them to work overtime so they start with Malloy ticketing a woman for not stopping for a right turn on red on the way back to the station. At the station Mac asks them to give a female police commissioner a ride along that evening - she was the woman Malloy just ticketed for not stopping. The officers draw a second shift and must escort the new woman police commissioner on a ride along. First call is to a bar where the owner has locked up an elderly man who took off all of his clothes. Second call is to a fight where a man has been stabbed. A young boy tells Reed the man who is talking back to them is the one who stabbed the man. Reed separates him and the man says the other man had a gun which Reed finds. They receive a call about a missing 17 year boy who is deaf and emotionally disturbed. While taking his description, they realize it is the boy Reed chased on the previous shift. When Reed goes to put out a supplemental call on the boy, he discovers another car is in pursuit of the boy in a car. He calls for Malloy and Mrs. Dixon and they join the pursuit in time to tell the other officers the boy is deaf. When an old man wearing a strange-looking belt is found dead of natural causes, fraud is suspected and the case is turned over to major frauds division. Investigation leads to a Dr. Gantman, whose useless treatment of a blind seven-year-old girl with a pituitary tumor is preventing its timely surgical removal. A break comes when a television repairman, who makes "electro-charged oscillator belts" for the doctor, is arrested for bookmaking and is willing to testify against him. The bookie isn't needed after a courtroom demonstration by the doctor, and participation by the prosecution, results in the doctor's undoing. Reed's wife was told her credit rating was no longer good when she went to buy a new washer so Reed visits the credit agency to find out why. They are called to a parking lot where a woman says her car was hit by another car but the driver left. She provides a description and license number of the car. The officers look up the owner of the offending vehicle but she denies being involved even though her car has been in an accident. Reed returns to the agency to learn he has a very poor payment history. A store owner reports that two small boys broke into his basement storage area and stole camping gear. A another man spots the boys hitchhiking and turns them over to the officers. When they respond to a liquor store robbery, they mistakenly arrest the store manager who is chasing the robber with a gun. Reed learns that his name was confused with another James Reed with a different middle initial. Reed realizes mistakes can be made and decides to make further checks on the license number of the hit and run accident turning up the real culprit. Malloy sits one out as Reed drives and pairs up with a new partner: Dana Hall, a policewoman! The sexual attitudes of the 1970s run rampant with Wells representing the worst of the era while Reed, ever the Renaissance Man, treats his temporary partner with respect and bemusement. Adam-12 attend to a call at a gas station that has just been held up in an armed robbery. The gas station owner, Mr. Williams, seems solely focused on the fact that he was held up by a black man to provide much more useful information to Malloy and Reed. His racial overtones are also implied in an interview he gives to a television news crew, which ends up having unintended consequences for Mr. Williams and a motorcycle officer. Next, they are pulled over by a man, Paul Soren, who, not wanting to issue a formal complaint but only provide information, tells them of just being extorted out of $20 by a late teen, female hitchhiker he had picked up. She threatened to yell rape unless he handed over the money. Although Soren provides an accurate description of the girl, Malloy and Reed don't tell him that barring any unforeseen luck, the likelihood of catching her is remote at best seeing as to the "he said/she said" nature of such an encounter. Then on patrol, they notice one of their regular drunks, Willie, inebriated as usual staggering on the side of the road. Beyond the unusual libation he has in his possession - imported champagne - Malloy and Reed are surprised by his unrealistic story on how he came upon the bottles, the story which seems to be coming from somewhere deeper than just a drunken state. A pair of motorcyclists snatch handbags and go off-road down trails where police officers cannot follow in their patrol cars. A motorcycle club in the area is suspected but never caught. Reed invites them to a community meeting to air their complaints on their continued harassment. When they attend, their leader challenges Malloy to a duel and they settle on a dirt bike race. Reed must teach Malloy how to race on a dirt course. Malloy loses the race but seems to gain some respect from the leader of the club. On patrol, Reed spots a suspicious license plate and traces it to a hot car. When another purse snatching occurs, the pursuit ends at the dirt trails. However, this time the motorcycle club is on the other end of the trail and forces the thieves back to Malloy and Reed where they surrender. They are not part of the club. Reed leaves juvenile court after losing a case against a seventeen year old car thief and his dad's attorneys. On patrol they are called to house where a woman says she is afraid her boyfriend is sick from heroin but they find he has died potentially from a hot shot. The girl has been clean for two months and tells them her boyfriend's connection name. Malloy spots the teenage car thief in a car but it is his dad's. The girlfriend, Cindy, returns with the address of the pusher but Malloy says they need more. Later they pull over an elderly woman in an old car for unsafe driving but she refuses to sign the ticket forcing them to arrest her. Cindy returns with drugs she bought and the serial number of the ten dollar bill she bought it with. The officers with the narcotics squad stakeout the house and finally arrest the pusher. Another squad car calls for help during a potential robbery. The driver is the young man Reed was in court with. They end up in a pursuit of the car ending in an accident fatal for the teenager. A door-to-door search for a missing girl in a red sweater leads to a foot chase with the pedophile who kidnapped the youngster. Malloy catches the suspect, then loses his cool when the suspect makes a smart remark. The suspect fights back by filing an excessive force complaint against Malloy. Malloy admits what he did and accepts the consequences, even though he knows it could affect his long-term career goals. Patrol starts with a call to a robbery at a bar and a car chase but the thieves escape. A call to a dry cleaners concerns the owner being extorted for protection money along with other shop owners who are Jewish survivors of the Holecaust. The dry cleaner wants to press charges but others are fearful of retribution. Two men are captured but two escape. Some searching turns up the car used in the robbery and a lead on the second car they used to escape. This is followed by a return call to the dry cleaners where the owner's panel truck is burning. During patrol they spot the second car used in the escape and a chase ensues resulting in their capture after Malloy comes close to taking a shotgun blast. They close out with another call to the dry cleaners where the owner has been attacked. With a tip from a nearby store owner they track down the two men responsible for the beating and destruction in the store. The pair have been helping with a search for a first grade boy missing after school. They return to patrol handling a loud dog complaint. Malloy realizes the dog is a seeing eye dog that has been stolen. A neighbor reports seeing a man and boy covered with blood getting into a taxi. They then spot the car suspected in the case of the missing boy. His father had picked up the boy and not told his mother. Family dispute call revolves around a wife upset with her husband unending football viewing smashing his TV. They trace the witness sighting of the bloody boy and a man, to someone who took his son to the hospital for a scalp injury. Next call is to close a report on a stolen car. Students had disassembled their professor's Beetle and reassembled it in his home. They close with a foot chase and shootout through a railroad park for men who killed a person in a robbery. They are aided by a police helicopter. Reed and Malloy handle a call about a stolen horse that someone is trying to sell to a horse stable. Also, after a call from a wealthy woman, she accuses them of stealing one of her valuable rings. Reed thinks Malloy should buy a used boat. At roll call Mac reports that three fishing rods and a custom made one of a kind pair of cowboy boots with green leather detail were stolen from his camper. He offers two steak dinners for their recovery. A report from a horse riding stable leads to Malloy, Reed, and Mac riding horseback to a remote mine shaft after the thieves where Mac hopes to find his boots but to no avail. When they return to the station, Officer Wells is taking up a collection for a man, his daughter and her baby to have gas money to make it to San Franisco for an operation on the baby for a tumor. Back on patrol they spot a man wearing boots that match Mac's one of kind boots but he is another officer who probably bought them from the same man in Mexico. The station comes under sniper fire forcing Mac to have Malloy and Reed set up a command station and take control of the situation. With the aid of the police helicopter they wound and capture the sniper. At the end as Officer Wells tells Mac he is sorry to hear his boots are not unique and he should look out for fakes in the future, Mac tells Wells the man he collected money for is a well known con-artist with a rap sheet everywhere west of the Mississippi River. A call about a suicide attempt at a hotel finds a women has tried to commit suicide for the second time but she is okay. She has left a note for another resident of the hotel. When they contact the man they recognize him as a convicted felon on parole involved with some serious mob activities. The man is a recluse and refuses to talk to the woman. The officers spot a man changing a tire and ask if he needs help but he says no. A second call to hotel occurs when the manager tries to evict the parolee because he types till 3:00 am but really simply wants the man evicted. When they hear a robbery report on the radio including the car the man was changing the tire on, they report it and a description of the man. They stop at the restaurant where the woman works to check on her and tell her why her friend refuses to see her which is due to a fear of someone from the mob being after him. Detectives locate the car and ask Malloy and Reed to help identify the owner which they do. A report of shots fired at the hotel finds the parolee has lost contact with reality and believes someone is after him forcing the officers into a gun battle until he runs out of ammunition. The men start with a theft report of an older car of little value. They return to the station to investigation a hunch and learn that older cars often tagged as abandoned are disappearing as noticed in other parts of the city. A call about an abandoned car blocking a woman's driveway provides them the chance to ask her to report if someone takes it. They spot a man at a bus stop matching a robbery suspect and when they check on him he runs forcing Reed into foot pursuit while Malloy tracks them in the car to catch him. They stop by a scrap metal company to ask the owner for any clues and he says that the wildcatters are not really wildcatters. A call about two boys who went into a house filled with lethal bug spray turns fatal for two boys by the time they get inside. The woman reports a tow truck taking the abandoned car. After stopping it, they find the truck has false labels on it covering the name of the scrap yard. At the scrap yard they are in luck as the equipment is broken allowing them to find the stolen car from the initial theft. Malloy is filling in for Mac, so Reed has a new partner (Gus Corbin) who has been on the job nine months. They stop a car with a woman and her daughter who are chasing a man who stole her purse. They find the purse in a garbage can outside a church and the suspect inside in the confessional. Reed and Corbin spot a break-in at a pharmacy where the thieves used the store to break into the pawn shop next door. One suspect is captured on the roof but Corbin defies Malloy's orders and searches the pawn shop before help arrives. He spots the second suspect and he and Malloy capture him. Afterwards Malloy gives Corbin a lecture on safety and risk taking with which Corbin agrees. A pursuit turns into a foot chase but Corbin loses his gun. He continues anyway catching the suspect who is unaware Corbin is unarmed. Adam-12's current patrol takes them down by the harbor. Their first call is to mediate a dispute between a marine gar bar operator and a customer, the latter who purports that the gar bar operator has been forging credit card chits. Malloy and Reed will only find out if that is indeed the case if they can get into his cash box. Next, they pull over a man with a color television set box strapped to the roof of his vehicle, the box about ready to fall off the roof. However, they find the man a little suspicious in his behavior, which will lead to the man wishing he hadn't purchased the factory sealed "box". Then, they pursue a car, the driver acting suspiciously. They will find that the driver and his female passenger are heading home... or so they say. Next, they pull over a reckless driver, who states that she couldn't have committed a traffic violation since she's a Libra and the stars, which never lie, say that today is her lucky day. Then, they have to deal with an armed drunk perched in a crow's-nest of a dry-docked boat. Throughout their shift, high on Malloy's mind is selling two tickets to an event he can no longer use. He is however reluctant to tell anyone what they're for for fear of ridicule.

When they arrive at the studio, gunshots are heard and they find two painters have been shot. They work with SWAT to rescue one painter and capture the sniper. At the end of the shift they meet the dispatcher but to Pete's dismay, she is married to the SWAT lieutenant.

They spot an abandoned and stolen car and call to have it removed. Reed spots a robbery in a store.

They receive a call about a domestic disturbance that turns into a shots fired call. A distraught man is in his house with his daughter. Reed and Malloy are able to rescue the girl even though the man had Reed in his sights. The girl is able to talk her dad out.

A call about a theft in a park leads to a tip that a man had his bicycle pump stolen from his bicycle and it might have contained drugs. Man complains about his grass being trampled by people shopping at his neighbor's never ending yard sale. When they investigate the sale, they find some of the items are stolen. The man running the sale is taking the items on consignment from a man who supposedly does repo work. They wait and arrest the man who gives them a tip on where a man wanted for murder is hiding leading to the man's capture. They learn that short sleeves were approved hours ago but missed the radio call. A drive through the park finds a woman in her car suffering withdrawal symptoms.

As they are helping him, descriptions of three fugitives from a bank robbery gone wrong come across the police radio. It isn't until Malloy and Reed start assisting the man that they find out that the vehicle is carrying two of the fugitives, who are able to take Malloy and Reed hostage by cuffing them with their own equipment, but not before Malloy is able to shoot one of the two in the shoulder. Reed's leg is also injured in the process. As Reed and Malloy do the "tough cop/soft cop" routine on their captors, they learn that Norm, the driver, is concerned more with self preservation which may work in their favor if only because he realizes being a cop killer has many negatives, and Steve, the one shot in shoulder, is the volatile and potentially violent one. But the real wild card is Susie, the sister of the third fugitive, seventeen year old Bill, who was killed in the robbery, and Norm's girlfriend. Malloy and Reed will have to learn more about the relationship between the three if they have any hope of getting out of their precarious situation. Mallory returns to duty with a new car. He lets Reed drive it to work. They leave the car parked in the street when they chase a purse snatcher and catch him in a dumpster. On their return they find someone scrapped the right front fender.

Malloy and Reed respond to a call about a drug overdose at Central Receiving Hospital involving a 15 year old boy. The boy has a jacket belonging to a 17 year old neighbor boy with drugs in the pocket. They follow up at the 17 year old's home in a high rise. When they ask the boy's mother to talk to him, they find he has barricaded himself in his room with a gun which he fires and threatens to kill himself. The mother is at a loss at what is happening and when the father arrives, they find he has an extreme overbearing attitude toward his son. Their options are limited due to the high rise structure. They bring his ex-girl friend to talk to him but he rejects her overtures. They have to crash the door and luckily the boy surrenders. Malloy and Reed bring an elderly man into Central Receiving for treatment.

Malloy and Reed deal with a suspicious looking elderly man carrying a couple of bags of items that probably don't belong to him, and a couple of drag racers. But most of their shift is preoccupied with a case at Amalgamated Products. Their first visit to Amalgamated is to investigate a reported theft. The owner, Phil Watters, is charging one of employees, Elmo Constant, of stealing one of the products they manufacture, which has since been returned. There are a couple of issues concerning this visit. First, that product is top secret which Watters is unwilling to hand over, and without it as material evidence, Constant cannot be charged. And second, Amalgamated's head of security is Ed Bowler, ex-LAPD, who was fired from the force for inappropriate conduct, with Malloy being one of the material witnesses which led to the firing. That antagonism between the two still exists. Later, Bowler calls in to report a suspicious package in a store room that he believes is a bomb. He believes this implicates Constant further as he is one of the few employees who has access to the restricted room. Beyond getting the bomb squad in to determine if it truly is a bomb, Malloy and Reed, with Bowler's assistance, have to determine if it is Constant who is the culprit. The on the job shooting death of Medal of Valor recipient Officer Tom Porter, Malloy's colleague and close personal friend, is the impetus for Malloy to relay Tom's story, documentary style as the narrator. As Malloy was Tom's friend even before they joined the academy together, he and Reed had the unfortunate task of breaking the news of his death to Tom's wife, Marge, who Tom and Malloy first met when they applied to become police officers, as Marge was the clerk at city hall. His death leaves Marge to raise their two infant children on her own. Tom excelled at most things related to the academy training and later on the job work, but those few things in which he didn't he was harder on himself than anyone else could be. Although Tom and Malloy's naive dream of being partners never materialized, their professional paths crossed often. Malloy has the honor of telling his story, if only the reason to do so was different. The duo is called to a press shop to take a theft report for a small offset press. Reed discovers a faucet used to break a window that proves to have the fingerprints of the thief. On the next call they are told an armed man has barricaded himself into a building scheduled for demolition the next day. He turns out to be a nearly blind man in his eighties with a non-functioning rusted old rifle. They agree to come back to take him to a home for the elderly but find he has runoff when they return. They find him on the street and convince him as their friend with a special relationship to check out the home. They encounter an army tank converted for legal road use. Malloy suggest the owner allow them to post a message about it in the police stations to reduce his encounters with the police. Finally a van running a red light leads to a chase and the capture of the thief of the press and the recovery of the press being used to print winning betting slips at the race track. Reed is on a high due a to meeting he and other probationers had with the Chief of Police. A ditsy young woman reports her 1958 Ford convertible stolen while she went in a liquor store. She left the keys in the car, has no paperwork, doesn't know the license number or other details but she needs it by 6:00 pm for a date! She finally tells the officers her pet 8 foot boa constrictor is in the trunk as she was coming from the vet. Every squad car is suddenly very careful with all 1958 white convertibles. They spot a fire in a house and rescue two drug users passed out in the fire. A stopped car turns out not to be the stolen car. They break up a dispute between two women when Reed tells them to stop the water fight or their pictures will be taken as they look when booked. They pull over a white car and the driver doesn't have the proper paperwork. He doesn't want them to search the trunk but Malloy does and finds marijuana. Another squad car reports finding Arthur when the thieves encounter the snake in a dark garage and scream for help. Malloy and Reed conduct a traffic stop, but decide to let the man off with a warning before the NCIC check is completed. In their haste, they let a man wanted on armed robbery and weapons charges go free. The lieutenant calls the officers in to scold them for not going "by the book," particularly since another officer could have responded to the scene of what turned out to be a routine domestic dispute. Malloy and Reed must then put their being scolded behind them as they come up with a plan to nab the wanted criminal. Malloy and Reed attend to a call of a possible jumper from an apartment building window, and another residential call of a landlady concerned about one of her long term tenants with lung and heart issues who she believes is unconscious in his unit. But it's their first call of the shift that keeps them the most preoccupied. They spot smoke, which ends up being an out of control warehouse fire. When they actually arrive on the scene - they being the first of the emergency responders - they spot a young man rushing into the warehouse upon hearing screams for help inside. That young man, Lauro Perez, is able to bring that man screaming for help out alive. Lauro is seen by many as a hero, including the police department who want to award him a citation for his bravery. Upon arrival at the Perez home, Lauro's father is surprised at the news as Lauro himself never mentioned anything about the fire, but he, like everyone else, is proud of his son, and wants to honor Lauro in his own way. But Lauro himself doesn't seem to want the accolades. Malloy and Reed try to discover why Lauro is reacting the way he is. Patrol starts with a robbery suspect at a gas station and grocery store escaping Reed on foot. The pair are called in to quell a brewing fight between two gangs by a local priest. With backup they succeed in breaking up the rumble before the fight breaks out. A domestic dispute calls leads the pair to the robbery suspect who is sick after eating the food he stole. They are then called a second time to stop the gang fight but are too late to stop it. Reed dents the fender of the patrol car while putting gas in it and frets the entire shift about the impact of it on his career. At roll call Mac and the Lieutenant talk to the officers about a man who has been intimidating a woman who is to testify about the man's son's involvement in a crime. They talk to the woman, an influential neighbor, bartender where the man hangs out, and then the man himself. They respond to a call about a man holding a baby as a hostage with a gun. Malloy enters the house and talks the man down who appears to be high on drugs. A call that night by a neighbor leads them to catching the man after he used stones to break the woman's windows. At the end Malloy tells the Lieutentant that the dent is about the size of a reprimand. It's the Christmas Eve shift, and Adam-12, along with all the other units, is delivering donated toys to many of the disadvantaged families in the area in-between calls. One of those families is the Wards. Malloy and Reed learn directly from young Harvey Ward that he has his heart set on a yellow toy dump truck for Christmas. Beyond arranging to meet Mrs. Ward later to give her the toys then so that Harvey and her other kids won't see the toys before Christmas, Malloy and Reed discuss the pros and cons of themselves adding to the Christmas donations of a yellow toy dump truck for Harvey. Regardless of what Malloy and Reed decide to do about the toy, they later find out that Harvey may not get any presents at all as Mrs. Ward's old beater of a car gets stolen, along with all the toys in the trunk. With a few leads of past GTA cases from Sgt. Miller, Malloy and Reed hope they can locate Mrs. Ward's car by the end of the shift to get the toys back to her. But Reed also realizes that the toys may not get back to Wards regardless by Christmas, unless he and Malloy can do some sweet talking to Miller. The other issues Adam-12 deals with on this shift are a too common one on this day, namely a drunk driver, who has far too much alcohol induced Christmas spirit, and a domestic dispute call where balancing the traditional festivities against the cost of doing so is the issue of contention between husband and wife. Malloy and Reed just hope that that Christmas spirit, which got the couple into their argument, will also get them out of it. Of the three outstanding warrants Adam-12 has to serve, Malloy wants to focus on the one to James Llewellyn Brown. Although it is solely for failure to appear on a traffic violation, Malloy recognizes his name as a past drug dealer. Malloy believes Brown is a potential flight risk and asks for backup. Indeed, Brown does attempt to run until he is told they are there solely on the traffic violation issue. However, Reed, in securing the house for Brown's departure, eventually finds drugs and drug paraphernalia in Brown's kitchen, which Malloy and Mac realize is a gray area as Brown was served the warrant in his living room, and whether the kitchen still constitutes in the general vicinity of the where the warrant was served or whether it was off limits as to where Reed could/should have been in the house without a search warrant is up for interpretation. Despite basking in the glory among the other officers at the station for the seizure, Reed finds that his status in court is a little different. Adam-12's first call takes them to Van Nuys Airport, where a prop plane has been stolen. They find out the thief has taken the plane up in the air, is seemingly drunk or stoned, and worse inexperienced, he who believes he can fly the plane. Beyond the possibility of a crash, they just hope that he does not cause any on-ground injuries or fatalities. Their next call is to follow up on a lead of a missing runaway from the Midwest. When they arrive at the address which is a rundown vacant house, they do see signs that a male and female are living there, that they do not want to be found, but that the residents are probably still within hearing distance of Malloy and Reed. They just have find out their hiding spot. Next, they are called to a store robbery that occurred on Saturday night, so as not to be noticed until Monday morning. The item stolen is as unusual as the wrinkle associated with the case: a three foot high safe, which the burglars are unaware is booby-trapped to explode if opened through any other means besides the combination. There are leads for this case which they hope pan out before anyone is injured through the explosion. And they attend to a armed robbery in process at a grocery store. Malloy and Reed handle a safe cracking case where the MO is an old one used by several men. However, it was known to be the specialty of one man Malloy previously arrested. When they look up the man, they learn he has taken in a niece and nephew whose parents were killed. He provides Malloy and Reed with a hint about another store he knows has the same type of safe they should check. A noise complaint at a hotel escalates to a theft complaint. A man is taken advantage of by a woman and apparent accomplice. They find the woman and she tells them she is the victim of a cousin who taken her baby as hostage and is forcing her to meet and steal from men. They arrest the man and recover the baby. Following up on the hint given by the safe cracker they find the thieves in action and not what they expected. A call regarding stolen milk turns into a call about child neglect. When the officers knock on the door to question a suspect, they find a 6 year old girl Charlie alone. She says she doesn't know where her mother is and her dad no longer lives there. When the officers tell her they are removing her, she tells them she can't leave Sissy an infant in the bathtub. A man arrives she calls daddy but he is only a friend of the mother. He is arrested on outstanding traffic warrants and juvenile finds the kids have been beaten. Charlie says daddy did it. They are called back to the apartment to find the father beating the mother and they learn the mother is beating the kids. Malloy is still in the process of training the rookie Reed. Before their shift the officers trade comments with two detectives. Reed inquires whether Malloy has considered moving from patrol to the detective squad. They receive a missing child call from a frantic mother but quickly find the boy under the house with a cat and her new litter. TJ, a recovering addict flags the officers down and tells them about a scuffle he heard at the hotel where he stays. They find a man stabbed and dead. Malloy teaches Reed the proper procedures to preserve the scene and calls the detectives who take over. Reed is hot to help but Malloy explains they their job is on patrol. An illegal parking call requires the officers to explain the proper signage required again. A domestic dispute tests their patience. Malloy spots a hot car resulting in a pursuit and arrest of two men with drugs. The excitement has Reed forgetting his angst over the murder investigation. They learn a relative sobered up and copped to the murder on his own. Reed's dog has eight pups ready for new homes but he can't find them homes. They respond to a silent alarm where a young man and girl have tunneled through the wall between two stores. They spot a crowd around a boy who has stuck his head through a iron fence but cannot pull his head out. When grease fails, Reed uses the car's jack to free the boy. After a waitress turns out to be a cat person, they handle a prowler call from a nice looking 23 year old woman. Someone has been prowling around outside her windows for several nights and another patrol flushes out a suspect. Reed may have finally found a home for a puppy but she wants Malloy to deliver it. After their code 7, Malloy and Reed find a police dog in their patrol car. Reed admits it is his fault as he didn't close the window before their break. They find that the dog getting into the car was probably easier than them being able to get the aggressive dog out. Next, they attend to a baby kidnapping case. The frantic mother of the child reports that the kidnapper is her long since separated husband, who had threatened to do something drastic unless they reconciled. By the end of their shift, Malloy and Reed, who first and foremost want to see the safe recovery of the infant, will see that there are two sides to this story. Their next call takes them to a restaurant, where a customer, who has just finished his meal, is trying to pay his bill with a less than standard method. While on patrol, Malloy and Reed spot a public transit bus stopped at the side of the road, with the driver and most of the passengers off the bus. The driver reports that a man asleep at the back of the bus is carrying a concealed gun. Malloy and Reed have their suspicions on the sleeping man's story even before boarding the bus to investigate. Also while patrolling, they spot the driver of a pizza delivery truck give them a somewhat secretive hand signal. They will soon find that the driver did so not to alert his two unwanted passengers. Malloy and Reed attend to a couple of domestic dispute calls. The first has the wife mad at her husband for wanting to watch a football game on television. It isn't so much watching the game itself, but with who he wants to watch it. The second domestic dispute involves a husband who escaped from a mental institution, and now has his wife hostage at knife-point threatening to kill her. In-between, they attend to a possible jumper from a third story window. When they reach the window, they find the man's purpose on the ledge is a little less deadly than wanting to jump, but is nonetheless potentially as dangerous. But Malloy and Reed's time over several shifts is attending to vehicle arsons, often set by lighting flammable materials in garbage cans. They often arrive on the scene while the fires are still ablaze, but the arsonist long gone. Whenever there have been witnesses, they have not been totally helpful. Malloy and Reed just hope that they or another unit can catch him in the act before he kills someone, or before others get similar ideas. Malloy and Reed return from vacation to learn a burglar is still stealing color TV sets. They receive a call about two endangered boys. After breaking into their apartment, they find the boys comatose and their mother's drug stash laying on the floor. The mother arrives and tries to act as if nothing is wrong. When Reed tells her she is under arrest, he becomes very irritated with her forcing Malloy to tell him later he must stay professional. Malloy gives a beautiful but spoiled young woman a ticket for an unsafe left turn while she berates him for harassment. They spot a car with a TV in the back seat and a man who runs forcing them to chase him. He and Reed end up in a pool but he denies stealing the TV. After running him at the station, they learn he stole jewelry while posing as a gas repairman. Still no TV thief. As he is now a father, Reed is reading up on dogs in relation to children, believing it will also assist in any cases that involve the need to identify dog breeds. Early on in Adam-12's shift, they stop a motorist on a routine non-functioning brake light issue. Although the on-paper items with this stop check through, Malloy notices something that may make this not a routine stop. Next, they are called to a medical supply warehouse, where a silent alarm has been broken. Inside, they find the perpetrator who in many ways could not have chosen a better warehouse to break into for what he is going through. But in processing this case, Malloy and Reed also have to deal with a group of irate men outside, they who spotted the patrol car and refuse to let them carry out their duties as the brother of one of those men was recently arrested - unfairly in his mind - and deal with the uncooperative owner of the medical supplies company who is solely concerned about his personal property and not anyone else involved. Their final call is a residential noise complaint in an apartment building called in by the wife of the building's superintendent. Upon their arrival, Malloy wishes Reed had read up on another species of animal besides dogs in relation to children. Adam-12 attends to a landlord/tenant dispute turned violent. Although the landlord is legally in the right, they can understand at least why the tenant is so disgruntled. Johnson, the tenant, used a stolen vehicle in the incident, that belonging to a Jay Finlay. As the car was not reported stolen, they assume rightly that Mr. Finlay has no idea that his car is gone. When they arrive in the largely family friendly neighborhood where the Finlays live, Malloy and Reed learn from a belligerent neighbor, Efiginia Grimes, that there have been a rash of robberies throughout the neighborhood, an item stolen here and there, with no major robberies from any one place. Malloy and Reed will eventually learn that there are two elements at play, one which involves a young boy who just wanted a room of his own. Malloy and Reed are heading to the Terry house to issue a warrant for the arrest of Mrs. Terry on a felony charge for hitting her husband over the head with a beer bottle. On their arrival, they find only Mr. Terry at home. What happens next surprises the two officers. Their next call is a residential burglary in an apartment building. The thieves left a trail of some of the burglarized items. Following the trail, Malloy and Reed not only discover why that trail was left, but discover that victims can also be perpetrators, and visa versa. While on patrol the next day, Malloy and Reed are flagged down by a man, John Lewis, who tells them that he has spotted his stolen car, more precisely stolen pieces of his car - the hood and fenders - which are now on someone else's car. He has to be able to prove that is indeed the case before Malloy and Reed will sit and wait for the owner of that vehicle to return. Before that can happen, Adam-12 is called to a bank robbery in progress at which they hope to arrive quickly enough to be able to stop without incident before it's completed. Following the bank robbery, Malloy and Reed learn about the fate of Mr. Lewis' car parts, and why he was so dismayed at the positive outcome of his case. And over the course of the past day, Malloy changes his mind concerning a personal request by Reed. A sniper named Johnny Kursko is terrorizing a neighborhood in an urban section of the city. He is on top of a building that was once housed a movie theater that the sniper worked at. It is later found out that he is an escaped fugitive from New York and he is shooting up the neighborhood as a way to get back at the people in the neighborhood who he holds responsible for the theater's closing. Reed, Malloy and Detective Sgt. Gus Brown get into their SWAT gear and go after Kursko and try to get him without any further bloodshed. Before shift Officer Ed Wells impresses all the new officers including Reed with stories of his ignore all danger style of police work. The senior officers including Malloy are not impressed or happy. Wells ignores Malloy's desire to safely handle a man with a gun and hostage and busts in taking the suspect whose gun shot misses Wells. Reed is impressed with Wells while Mac chews Malloy out for not handling his own calls. A call about a man taking a boy turns out to be a father trying to take his son to the barber. Malloy and Reed backup Wells on a call about a man with a shotgun. Wells rushes the house but is downed with a load of buckshot. Malloy and Reed use their car to shield them as they rescue Wells. They visit Wells in the hospital and Reed has learned another lesson. A break in the "Mulholland Mauler" case when a victim survives provides details about the car, etc. Adam-12 is asked to patrol the area to look for suspects. They ticket a young girl for hitchhiking and warn a young couple parked in the hills to leave. A car pulled over over matches the description but there is no conclusive evidence. He is the most likely suspect of the several men picked up. They find an empty car owned by a young woman and locate her friend at a nearby service station. They persuade the suspect to show them where the missing girl was dumped and find her alive. The show starts with Officer Tony Johnson saving Malloy's life when he is almost gored by a fork lift while they arrest men committing a warehouse robbery. After the shift Johnson turns down Malloy's offer of a steak dinner as he has been told a complaint has been lodged against him for blackmail. Malloy believes him to be innocent and Johnson tells them his version of the story. He needs to find a B girl named Ginger who he says can clear him. Malloy and Reed are called to a bar where they happen to find Ginger and she eagerly tells a story exactly like Johnson's leading Malloy to confront Johnson about the truth. Reed provides a hint via a tip to a waitress at a restaurant where Reed is forced to intervene in a dispute. Malloy and Reed are embarking on two tasks outside of their normal patrol. First, they are training for the upcoming police Olympics, where Mac hopes that ex-track star Reed will bring home at least one gold medal. And second, they are doing school outreach. With the latter, the latest school has them talking to a group of grade 5's. The students are an eager bunch, except for one boy - Tony Niccola - who they learn from Principal Wesley is generally a good boy despite his standoffishness. When Malloy and Reed find that the tires on their cruiser have been slashed just before they are about to leave, they naturally assume Tony the culprit if only because he was seen with a pocket knife, which is now conveniently missing. However, Tony vehemently denies having done the deed. The next day, Malloy and Reed are Olympics training at the local high school, where many of the grade 5's have come to watch. The surprise attendee is Tony. To show he trusts him, Reed asks Tony to get a stop watch out of Malloy's car, to which he agrees. That act, plus a visit by Tony's father, demonstrates why Tony has been so detached of late, and determines once and for all who slashed the tires the day before. While Jim and Pete discuss their recent double-date, Malloy complains how his latest girlfriend is now hinting for marriage. Between their social chatter, they resolve a liquor store robbery, rescue a woman and baby from a hillside crash, intervene with a marital couple disturbing their entire neighborhood, and enjoy lunch at a place with cute waitresses. The first call is a police garage employee taking a police car for a "Code 3" ride followed by a young woman trying to cash an Old Age Benefits check she found. Malloy and Reed are accused of poaching Officer Ed Wells' territory when they check some warehouses in Wells' area that has been having a rash of break-ins. They both have a nervous time in a mortuary that has been broken into and the thief is found hiding in a casket. During rounds they finally catch a pair of men high on drugs breaking into a warehouse. While on beat patrol they come across a homeless man who has been stabbed. They suspect a retired policeman, Jack Donohoe, living in the run down area who always seems to be on the scene at crimes there and take him in for questioning. That is followed by a call about a woman shooting a phone booth at Union Station. She has been bilked out of her money by an agent promising her a career in movies after coming from Missouri and then they find that her suitcase was stolen by a man who switched locker keys on her. The suitcase contains her pet rattlesnake, Henry. Donohoe is released when it is determined someone else is guilty and they drop him off at Union Station with a warning. They are called back to Union Station again to arrest a robbery suspect who fires at them. However, Donohue intervenes in the incident. The day starts with a robbery in progress by two men at a bar. Malloy is forced to shot one of the men. The shift continues with Malloy warning a young woman in a bad neighborhood at a store to pick up food for her friends that she should be careful and to avoid the area in the future but she makes light of the issue. The pair handle a call at an apartment building about noise indicating a domestic dispute but the couple living there report no problems even though her face is severely injured. While back on patrol they notice two men helping the young woman with her car. When they check the men's car, they are wanted for kidnapping. With the aid of a helicopter patrol they are able to capture the men and rescue the woman. They close the shift with a return to the apartment complex where the mother asks for their help for her daughter and the men have to chase the husband through the parking lot as he tries to escape. Malloy and Reed pull over a driver for reckless driving and speeding. The driver a wealthy young spoiled gorgeous blonde tries to talk Malloy out of a ticket but fails. To Malloy's and the rest of the force dismay she develops a crush on Malloy leading to fake police calls along with expense gifts. Mac finally has to tell Malloy to solve the issue one way or another. Mac and Reed notice that Malloy's thoughts are elsewhere when told that Adam-12 is to report to Summer's Department Store on a reported shoplift. Reed soon learns it's because the store's security investigator, Jane Hayes, is an old flame of Malloy's who he has not seen in a while. Jane is a police officer who works at the store on her days off. They broke up a year earlier because Malloy could not handle dating a policewoman. There are feelings still between them, despite she now being engaged to someone else. The shoplifter, who Jane has in custody, is nineteen year old heiress M'Liss Courtnay. M'Liss is a chronic shoplifter at the store, the so far small items stolen which store management always placed on her father's charge account after the theft. This time, the item was a little more substantial, a diamond watch retailing at $2,500, but not found on her person when arrested. Malloy and Reed's investigation takes them to the Courtnay home to see what her father and stepmother know about M'Liss' activities, her parents who deal with the situation in their own way. Malloy and Reed end up believing M'Liss' shoplifting has something to do with a new ageist cult to which it looks she is a member. But something also happens to M'Liss along the way which adds an unwanted twist to the case. Malloy and Reed blaze through a new opening credits sequence. They investigate the beatings of several people in a factory parking lot only to reveal a gambling/loan shark operation with the heavies working over those behind on their loan payments. One lone schoolboy stands up to the organization and commits himself to help the police and testify in court. Along their way they arrest an armed robber of a liquor store who out of guilt could only take $2 from the attendant, and was subsequently robbed himself. Malloy and Reed are busying tracking the exploits of the con artist Johnson family making their annual pilgrimage through Los Angles ripping off people. They involve false delivery of wood, bogus roof repair, and finally catching rattlesnakes for a couple of elderly sisters. Mixed in is the capture of a two men trying to burn a plant where one of them had been fired as a security guard for drinking on the job. Officer Pete Malloy, a seven year veteran of the LAPD and the senior man in his division's patrol, is getting a new partner: twenty-three year old Officer Jim Reed, who has just graduated from the academy in the top-10 in his class. Regardless of Reed's on-paper credentials, Malloy is not happy, not only about having to break-in a neophyte officer, but also about something that happened in his professional life three weeks earlier, which is making him contemplate his future, that incident which he refuses to disclose to or discuss with Reed. This evening, their unit, called Adam-12, deals with what looks to be an altercation between two men and a woman on the street, two suspicious men who looked to be casing a liquor store, and a baby who may have died from suffocation in a dry cleaning bag. But it's their last call of the evening - a shooting in a pitch black park - and Reed's actions at that call which makes Malloy have a clearer picture about his future and that incident three weeks earlier. Wells tells Reed a joke before shift that has Reed in stitches which he tells Malloy in between calls on the shift. An elderly lady reports her jealous friends took a mink scarf. She keeps it in the refrigerator but Malloy discovers it in the freezer. A domestic dispute has an angry husband cutting his wife's hand but Malloy has a bad feeling about it. Further checking proves Malloy right. They wanted the husband arrested to increase their welfare payments. Reed finishes the story with Malloy and two officers at dinner but only one of the officers thinks it is funny. A noisy party call involves Reed's high school friend who thought Reed would ignore the issue but Reed forces him to quiet down the party much to everyone's displeasure. A pair of black hoodlums shoot and kill a respected black couple during a grocery store robbery. Reed and Malloy sent in to capture the killers. They keep their cool, knowing that given the heightened racial tensions, the wrong thing said could spark deadly violence, and are assisted by a young resident who helps to keep the peace. Two officers are critically wounded in the high speed pursuit of a vehicle suspected in a hit and run. Because of the pall it places on the station, Malloy asks Reed if he wants to postpone the BBQ the Reeds are hosting tomorrow for him. Reed decides to go ahead with it. Upon Malloy's arrival at the Reed's, he understands why Jean was so anxious to go ahead with the gathering: it is a blind date of sorts as there is a fourth, a high school friend of Jean's named Ruth Bannister. The timing of the BBQ may also not be good timing for Ruth, as the talk between Malloy and Reed gives her an idea of what it would be like to be in a relationship with a police officer. Malloy and Reed are also preoccupied by Reed's new project: fixing up a jalopy of a pickup truck, a project he is working on with his next door neighbor, fifteen year old Tim Richmond. Their already unusual social gathering gets more unusual when Tim stumbles into the picture. He is strung out, on what Malloy and Reed believe is some illegal drug. They have to ensure Tim is all right, determine what he took, contact his parents, and try to figure out where he got the drugs. By the end of the evening, there is a fairly clear picture if there is even a chance for a Malloy/Ruth future. Malloy and Reed confront a series of explosions due to a protection racket. They happen upon a shooting as it occurs while hunting the bomber. That is followed with a call to a bar where a fight was reported between Apache Indians but the fight has stopped when they arrive. Later they receive a tip that a fight to the death is about to occur between the Apaches because one of them is seeing the other one's 16 year old sister. Malloy and Reed start the shift with a holdup at a grocery store by two men. When the men leave with hostages they are able to overtake the holdup men. The pair are faced with a rash of burglaries in their area resulting in calls to some very disgruntled citizens. When they detect a car driving erratically they pull it over to find a man who has kidnapped a young girl. The department introduces a new program named LEMRAS (Law Enforcement Manpower Resource Allocation System) to predict where criminals may strike. A call to another burglary results in learning the robbers are using motorcycles as the getaway devices but there are never any signs of the motorcycles. Reed volunteers to find entertainment for the department party but he is having poor luck and his options left are poor. They spot TJ, an informant, who tells them about a possible drug house. They spot a woman and girl at the same bus stop an hour apart. When they stop to talk to her, she tries to run. They learn she is from New Mexico looking for her husband but doesn't know how to contact him and has no money. She stole but did not open a box of cookies. The officers take her to the Salvation Army. That night they locate the drug house and call in support. They arrest five people but it takes a detailed search to find the drug stash in a shower drain. Reed successfully asks a well known country singer to perform when they serve him with a subpoena. Reed is a hit with most of the officers. While on patrol in a residential area, the officers suddenly take fire from Reed's side of the car at night. Reed fires at the person he believes is firing at them after he sees gun flashes and a gun barrel. After the shooting he and Malloy are taken to the station where the shooting board grills both of them but especially the rookie Reed about the events that took place. They want to make sure all concerns and issues are covered but to Reed it feels like an Inquisition. At the end he is told the shooting appears to be justified but not before his confidence is shaken. Big talking Wells is excited to be the first officer assigned to the new helicopter patrol, which had been tested in another division to great success. Wells wants this assignment to lead to a life as a helicopter pilot. Adam-12's first call of the shift doesn't use the helicopter patrol as it is an inside job. After overcoming the language barrier with the solely Cantonese speaking servants, Malloy and Reed learn that the wealthy owners of the house to which they are called are locked inside the house's full sized safe by the people who burglarized the house. Adam-12 and the safe unit have to work fast as the people inside may run out of oxygen if they can't get inside quickly enough. Their second call involves two men who robbed a jewelry store, the robbers who managed to escape on motorcycle. The jewelry store owner provides a basic description of the men, which allows Adam-12 to bring into the fold the chopper unit to follow the motorcycle through the streets of Los Angeles, Wells providing information back to Adam-12 on the motorcycle's whereabouts. Beyond the outcome of this tail, the question becomes whether all the other chopper's future duties will have the same outcome. Malloy and Reed pull over a driver on what looks to be a routine traffic violation. Beyond finding that the driver, Mr. J. Simmons, is inebriated, they have more pressing concerns about dealing with Mr. Simmons, which requires backup, albeit not of an emergency nature. Next, they are called to a pharmacy, where the pharmacist notices one of his regular customers changing his spending behavior well beyond his normal means, which may indicate some level of criminal behavior. The problem is that the perpetrator, generally known as a good person, is only nine years old. And as afternoon turns into night, Malloy and Reed, on patrol, notice a van on what looks to be suspicious activity. As they observe the goings-on of the two men in the van after the van is parked, they believe they've come across a high end auto parts theft and sales ring. They have to sit and wait for some illegal transaction to take place as a van full of auto parts alone does not a crime make. Reed starts the day with filing a report on being conned out of $300.00 by a door to door salesman who modifies a $30.00 check Reed gives him. Officer Ed Wells gives Reed a hard time about being too trusting which is further embellished when Reed buys a day old newspaper from a young boy. On the street they are faced with a fight by two men over a marijuana plant. It is followed by a woman running to a bank for a $1000 ransom for her young baby being held by a mentally unstable and armed man. Finally they are called to a home where a hysterical woman tells them a man in a light colored shirt shot at her. Reed and Wells catch a man fitting the description in the backyard but the man says he is innocent. Reed wants to see if the woman can identify him but Wells takes him to the station under arrest. After the woman calmed down she told Mally the man who shot at her was her drunk husband who shows up again threatening her and Reed. Wells is then faced with a chewing out by Sgt. MacDonald for making the false arrest giving Reed some revenge and smiles. Malloy and Reed are just about go on their meal break at one of their regular hang-outs, Duke's. While Reed goes to buy a newspaper first, Malloy goes into the restaurant to grab a table. What Malloy walks into is a hold-up, he who is immediately shot upon entering. Reed quickly calls in the fires shot, and the restaurant is soon surrounded by police. The hold-up men - Reed knows that there are at least two of them - state that Malloy is indeed shot but that he is still alive. They also state that one of the hostages, a retired rodeo performer named Stony, who Reed knows as one of Duke's regulars, has bad lungs, to which Reed can attest, which further means no tear gas as that would kill Stony. They surmise that the two hold-up men are Bernie Ryan and Vince Warren, who had just escaped from San Quentin, and are the type of men who wouldn't hesitate to shoot to kill. Indeed, Bernie states there is no way he is returning to prison. Everyone realizes that it is virtually impossible for Bernie and Vince to escape alive, so the questions become whether there will be any casualties, and if time is against an injured Malloy. Reed is approached by a businessman named Erickson, who offers him a proposition. Reed was the arresting officer in a drunk driving case two weeks earlier of Erickson's son, Bill Erickson. That case is soon going to court, where Reed will testify. If Bill Erickson is convicted, he could go to jail as it would be his third offense. Regardless of the outcome of the court proceeding, Erickson wants to offer Reed a lucrative job at triple his current salary. Despite Erickson stating it is not such, both Reed and Malloy see Erickson's offer as a bribe, which Reed turns down, and which they report to Lieutenant Moore. Lieutenant Moore believes Erickson will provide that same offer to Malloy once he realizes that Malloy could also testify since he was at the scene. That does indeed occur. Reed's testimony, the verdict and sentence if there is one, and the status of the job offers following will determine if the job offers were indeed bribes and if there is a case against Erickson for doing so. Meanwhile, Malloy and Reed are approached by a friend of Duke's, John Thomas, an elderly man who tells them the has just killed his long time wife, Irene. It is a case of mercy killing. The question is what will happen to Mr. Thomas in light of his loving motive despite it being considered premeditated murder in the eyes of the law. Malloy and Reed have a monotonous day interrupted by two rambunctious female felonious joyriders, an exceptionally bright young boy with a photographic memory named Harold that clues them into a home burglary ring disguised as movers, respond to two paint-sniffing country bumpkins shooting rifles at a suspended box of dynamite, and check out a beauty school client who lodges a potentially explosive complaint. While at the station, Malloy and Reed decide to check in on Harold to discover he doesn't see the burglar's mugshot in the books. When they give Harold a ride home, Harold spots the burglar. Malloy and Reed make a successful, albeit bullet riddled, arrest and solve the crime while proving Harold's brilliance to the police department's doubting detectives. In this Christmas themed show Malloy and Reed confront a man who robbed a bell ringing Santa Claus followed by a pregnant woman caught shop lifting. She tells the store manager and the officers she wanted to be caught so her kids would be taken some place for Christmas since her husband deserted her. The store manager has a change of heart and she is taken to social services for help. They also encounter a Native American couple with a young daughter from New Mexico who are unaccustomed to city life. Later they are found sleeping in the hills and their daughter has walked away requiring a search party. Not long after an elderly woman insists that Reed and Malloy help adjust her television antenna, the officers are called to a high-rise hotel, where a suicidal man is determined to jump. Malloy incorrectly handles the situation and Mac harshly reprimands him the follow-up investigation. Two young men are stalking Malloy and Reed while on duty taking pictures and talking to bystanders. They insinuate that the officers are frequently mistreating citizens. They attempt to interfere when the officers are asked to notify a woman that her merchant marine husband has passed away. After picking up a man on drugs and alcohol who injuries himself in the squad car, the men accuse the officers of injuring the man. The officers stop a car with three men wanted in a robbery. The two men appear and interfere with the officers resulting in one of the suspects pulling a gun and shooting an innocent bystander. In between some of their one off calls - a woman beating up on a car with a baseball bat, a suspected residential burglary in progress, and a theft at an auto mechanics shop - Malloy and Reed deal with a string of incidents which may implicate one of their own, Detective Hal Forest in Vice. Malloy and Reed attend to two separate incidents in which someone flashing a badge and having official police ID with Forest's name committed a crime. The first, "Forest" stole $350 from a boxing gym purportedly on a counterfeit money case. The second, "Forest" stole a gun from a pawn shop, threatening the owner not to report the incident or else. In both cases, the victim is able to provide a description which matches that of the real Forest. In addition, Malloy, who knows Forest well, is aware that he is facing some financial stress which may have made him get desperate. They are not to tell Forest of these incidents in the possibility that it is indeed Forest committing these crimes, while Internal investigates. But a third incident may provide the break in determining if it truly is Forest committing these crimes, and if not how the fake Forest was able to devise and carry out such a plan. Malloy and Reed rescue a cat and birds from an elderly woman's good intentions, a man from being robbed by his nephew, get help investigating a missing girl with a band-aid on her right leg from the little girl who lives down the lane, and respond to a auto robbery turned homicide where Malloy convinces a Hispanic family that the US law will protect them. Malloy is embarrassed at morning inspection as Mac notices that his driver's license has expired, meaning that he and Reed will have to switch responsibilities for their shift, which Reed relishes. As such, it's going to be a long shift for Malloy. On patrol, they are flagged down by a young teen girl, who tells them that a man in an ice cream truck tried to sell her drugs. What concerns Malloy and Reed the most is that the girl's description sounds like the pusher is targeting youth. Next, they attend to a call of a bank robbery in progress. Upon their arrival, they find that the robber is not all he appears on the surface. Next, they attend to a call from Lars Lowell, a man who had been out of town for six weeks, and upon arriving home found that everything in the house had been stolen. He knows who the thieves are from reports from a specific neighbor, one thief who is open about what she did and does not understand why what she did was wrong. Their next call is a report of a shooting at a house. They arrive to find a distraught woman wielding a gun who says she killed whoever is inside the house. They will have have to get the gun out of her possession to find out the complete story. Next, they receive a call about a man who found something of societal value in a trash can. Walters and Brinkman are on a roll lately and like to brag, much to the irritation of Reed. He and Malloy help them out by finishing one of their calls, then rescue a sick teenage girl and arrest the young man who took her in. Back on patrol, they meet an informant who gives them a tip on a big drug buy scheduled for 11pm. They give the info to Sgt. Miller who asks them to help in the bust. They banter with Walters and Brinkman during meal break then take a prowler call before it's time to set up for the big drug meet at 10pm. The bust is a bust and called off at 12:15am when nobody shows. The next day they find out Walters and Brinkman gave the buyer a traffic ticket at 10:30pm. At roll call, officers are cautioned about phony calls related to armed robberies. Reed and Malloy try to track down a noise coming from their car when they get a call of a stolen horse. At the stables, the owner offers them the use of two horses, but reluctant to ride themselves, the officers enlist the help of two park rangers to corral the horse thief. Back on patrol, the car noise getting worse, Reed and Malloy respond to a motel where they help a distraught young woman who bought the line of a cad. After sunset, Malloy ignores a call and heads to nearby liquor stores where they find armed robbers making a getaway. Fired upon, they give chase and pull the two men from their burning car after it crashes. Talking it over afterward, Reed notices the noise is gone. Reed shows up for work after taking his wife to the hospital for the delivery of their baby. He tells Malloy and Mac the key is organization. His day is anything but organized starting with forgetting to wear socks. Reed constantly tries to contact the hospital about his wife but they have lost track of her plus police calls interrupt him. They handle a drunk in the middle of a street believing he is bull fighting. They chase down a fleeing suspect called in by another car. A small boy fills in for his mother on a call about an apartment laundry coin box theft. Malloy decides to take Reed to the hospital but a boy on a bike causes Malloy to stop suddenly and scrape a parked car causing further delay. Mac shows up to tell Reed congratulations and Malloy finally gets Reed to hospital to see his new boy. It's Sunday, and as usual Malloy and Reed have picked up Louie, their resident drunk. Over the next few days, they deal with another alcohol related case. They first meet the Pilafs - husband and wife Christopher and Mae - when they are called to break up an altercation at a bar. From the questioning, they learn that the core of the problem is Mae's drinking, she who believes she can handle her booze, but who turns into a different person after a few drinks. Malloy and Reed later meet the Pilafs again, the couple who are trying to make their marriage work. But Mae's life seems to be a catch-22, where her drinking causes their latest problem, which in turn makes her want to drink to relieve the stress. In between dealing with the Pilafs, Malloy and Reed pull over a speeding vehicle which ends up being a case of good Samaritans that made a poor decision in providing their help. This case causes further problems for Adam-12 in an accusation after the fact. The shift starts with the officers pulling over a vehicle for a traffic violation. When Reed spots one of the men pulling a gun, they arrest them after learning the car is stolen. They find the body of a young woman which the men planned to dump in the ocean in the trunk of the car. The girl had stolen the car and the men who escaped from a mental institution killed her for seven dollars and the car. Later the officers are called to a home where a teenage girl's friends accidentally break a small window while toilet papering the house. The girl tells the officers the boys are planning to return but she refuses to name them. The officers roll by the house as the boys are in a fight with the father resulting in him being seriously stabbed. Malloy and Reed investigate a series of car thefts involving flustered, embarrassed male victims and scantily clad teenage girls working a strip joint for muscle cars. In between they stop an elderly woman with delusions of youth for running a red light, rescue a motorcycle thief from the feisty female owner, respond to a shut-in woman who believes she could be hallucinating only to find her nephew involved with hallucinogenics, and stop two men wheeling a large combination safe down the street. Reed & Malloy examine domestic disputes when the sergeant catches a black eye and they are called upon to stop a domestic dispute at an ashram. Later, a liquor store owner miscommunicates a robbery call and an elderly woman is mad at a neighbor's loud music until she learns there was a deadly accident. Each time the officers think first and act second. Malloy teases Reed about calculating the cost of a new house while their first baby is still 6 months away. In the meantime they settle a domestic dispute between arguing neighbors, help a taxi driver that was just robbed, and a local man mistaken as the President by a group of rural Mexicans. Finally, they must arrest a psychotic shooter holed up in his house. At college where he's taking a class, Malloy encounters resentment from Paul Banner and other radical students because he's a policeman. After arresting students at a sit-in at President Lane's office, Pete's new Mustang is trashed. Malloy and Lane later question the student who stole a timing device, who admits giving it to Banner. Malloy suspects Banner hid a bomb on campus and forces him to divulge its location. A few days later Pete is invited to a student meeting. Out of circumstance, primarily the result of Malloy's on-the-job sustained injured wrist, Malloy and Reed are assigned to the desk for their shift. Along with them is Officer Doris Mills, who is fresh out of the academy and who is assigned the desk for the next three months. Despite hoping that it will be a quiet night, they know it has the potential to blow up because of a student protest taking place in Grant Park. They are not so concerned about the student protesters who Malloy believes have some legitimate gripes, but rather the "sympathizers" i.e. those who seem to protest anything for the sake of causing a ruckus. Reed spends the better part of the start of the shift helping a walk-in who reported part of his car stolen, the process to report which would go faster if Reed knew the correct form to use. Meanwhile, Malloy and Mills deal with an elderly women picked up at the bus station for possible vagrancy. They use the soft approach in trying to get her story, which looks to be a dispute with her grown children. They just hope that she will provide the necessary information so that they can get her home safely. Later, Malloy and Mills process bail by a dejected father for his shoplifter son, the father who seems to have done everything right, and yet... And Malloy deals with another walk-in who is associated with an earlier arrest. The protest at the park does escalate which affects those at the desk indirectly and directly. The shift starts with Reed being taken hostage by a woman out of her mind. They are faced with multiple reports of burglaries in a neighborhood and the thieves appear to be young boys. After a couple interviews Malloy picks up on the fact that the victims are all supposed to be playing bridge and it points to one family. Mixed into their day they break up a fight over what music to play in front of a church between the choir director and organist. Malloy and Reed are called to the scene of an ambushed of two officers by a pair of black men. One officer is severely injured but tells them he believes he wounded one of the assailants. During a search Reed and Malloy find one of the assailants as he dies from his wounds in an alley. He is a member of a black militant group. At the hospital Reed sees a black friend, Kenneth James, and his family with whom he played football in school. They have to inform him it was his younger brother they found dead and later it is determined his older brother was the accomplice. The militant group accuses the police of murdering the younger James boy and Kenneth believes them even when Reed says it isn't true. When Kenneth confronts his older brother Cleotis, he learns the truth as Malloy and Reed arrest him. At roll call the officers are given a presentation on "officer presence" to keep control of heated events. A robbery at a gas station has the attendant pistol whipped but the suspect is gone. They locate a dog walker who provides additional details. A senior citizens home calls about an elderly man who wandered in. He is 91 and has been reported missing. A baby sitter reports a prowler. They hear the prowler who is a masked bandit - a raccoon. A silent alarm at a warehouse turns into a serious event when the four suspects shoot at Malloy and Reed and wound Walters. Malloy catches the last two with an unload gun. After it is over, Reed understands "officer presence". They receive a call about a woman screaming. They start to kick the door when they hear the same noise after knocking. An older woman opens the door revealing her and a friend practicing karate. The husband sporting a black eye called the police. The officers make a quick retreat. Malloy and Reed are called to an accident scene where a young woman was killed in a hit and run. Their questioning of witnesses lead them to the name of a suspect. Via older police data they locate the driver. He was planning to leave town but the woman told him she was pregnant and wanted him to go with him. However, the medical examiner found she was not pregnant. Malloy and Reed start the shift with a call to a liquor store robbery where a fellow officer was shot but the owner of the store appears to be lying. Further investigation pushes the owner to admit one of the thieves was his brother and he was trying to protect him. In the meantime, they have a zoning issue with an elderly lady who does astrology readings out of her apartment followed by the report of a young boy asking a pharmacist questions about Seconal pills he had. When they confront his mother, she is not very cooperative. They end with a shoot-out with the liquor store thieves at a stake-out. Malloy and Reed are called to a riding stable run by retired actor Slim Berkeley. The owner is careless about trusting people and has $100 and a gold belt buckle stolen. By instinct due to a record in New York his young assistant runs but when searched nothing is found. A call to a phone booth where the man inside is being attacked by another man leads to a drug arrest and sore jaw for Reed. Reed spots a robbery at a drive-in resulting in a shoot-out and capture of the robber. An illegally parked car with a woman who refuses to move the car leads to a second shoot out with two men robbing a liquor store. A complaint is filed by a jewelery salesman. His new convertible is poured full of concrete by the husband of his client in front of the client's house (the concrete had time to completely harden). When Slim reports a second robbery of his clients money, the mother of one the clients comes forward to say her daughter has a history of theft and she returns the belt buckle. Reed and a friend from the academy plan a fishing trip for the weekend before their shift. Malloy and Reed receive a Code 3 call as backup at a shooting. When they arrive Reed's friend is critically wounded and a suspect is dead. On patrol they arrest a man for DUI. Malloy allows Reed to test the man as part of his training. A call to a pool hall reveals a couple of men took a man to the hospital after hitting him with a pool cue. Reed continues to worry his wounded friend, Reed's wife who he can't reach, and her attitude. They spot two suspicious men in a convertible with a bicycle in the trunk. They pull it over and the two men run when Reed starts to run their IDs. At the end they learn Reed's friend has died. Two neighbors have started to feud over a jointly-owned motorboat. Malloy and Reed respond to several disputes at their home, with each neighbor becoming increasingly more frustrated and angry with the other at each turn. The officers warn the neighbors to settle the dispute before someone is seriously hurt. Alas, neither one heeds their advice and the situation ends in tragedy. Malloy and Reed hear through the grapevine that their snitch Tee Jay, for who Malloy got a job as a dishwasher at Duke's, has been using drugs again. This belief is strengthened when they attend to a call at an inner city church, where Tee Jay was seen by the priest just as the priest was beaten and the church funds stolen. Malloy and Reed manage quickly to locate Tee Jay, who seemingly is on the run from them, and who has the church's money on his person. But Tee Jay tells a different story of another unknown man who he saw beat up the priest and who he caught but who managed to get away, the reason he was on the run as he was chasing that man. The evidence, however circumstantial, starts to mount against Tee Jay, including getting caught in a few lies. But when all the players start to level with Malloy and Reed, the identity of the thief and the truth if Tee Jay is indeed using again come to light. Before Adam-12's shift, Malloy is confronted by Carl Owens, a former boxer who has just been released from prison after serving time for killing someone in a bar brawl. Malloy was one of the arresting officers. At the time of the conviction, Owens threatened revenge on Malloy whenever his release. This confrontation hangs over Adam-12 for the better part of their shift, Reed who seems more concerned for Malloy's safety. Their first call is an unknown residential noise issue, where the woman caller heard noise in her neighbor's garage for the better part of the night, which then stopped. When Malloy and Reed investigate inside the garage, they deal with two issues, the immediate one which ends up being more important as it is a matter of life or death. Next, as they patrol, they check out a liquor store with some seemingly unusual activity inside. Then on the way to their code 7, they get a flat. It's not needing to change the flat that bothers them, but rather having to deal with their onlooker. Following their eventual code 7, they attend to a call of a missing four year old child from an apartment building. And later on patrol, they track a vehicle where they spotted the driver conveniently dispose of some cargo - a bag of drugs - once he spotted the patrol vehicle. By the end of the shift, Malloy has a better idea if Owens is planning on carrying out his threat, and Reed has a better idea of how Malloy felt when Owens first threatened him. Malloy and Reed assist Officer Brinkman in tracking down a serial purse-snatching gang led by a teen named Benji. Brinkman goes undercover in drag while Malloy, Reed, and Sgt. MacDonald monitor from unmarked cars. Once the gang is apprehended, Malloy takes on Benji's inattentive father who can't seem to get it through his thick skull that purse snatching is a serious crime. Returning from their two days off, they respond to a 2-11 in progress where they find the store owner hit by a bullet and Benji, who was released after only one day, wielding a gun. Armed and desperate, Benji holes up in an alley where Malloy, Reed and Benji's father try to talk him out. An emotional discussion between Benji and Dad reveal the heart of the troubled youth. Dad tries to disarm Benji, with shattering results. While driving down the street, Malloy and Reed are pulled over by frantic parents, Jay and Mary Simmons, whose eight year old son, Jimmy Simmons, all of a sudden collapsed. Malloy and Reed rush him to the hospital emergency, the emergency room staff who are able to stabilize him. The diagnosis: diabetes. Jimmy expresses his fear of the hospital regardless of what is happening to him medically. So while unattended for a short time, Jimmy runs off. Emergency room doctor, Kelly Brackett, tells Malloy and Reed that Jimmy may go into a coma if he isn't found within a couple of hours. Based on something else Jimmy mentioned to Malloy, he and Reed follow the slim lead to try and find a hopefully still all right Jimmy. While at the hospital, Malloy and Reed decide to take their break there since Malloy's latest girlfriend, Kathy Stephens, is a nurse. Currently, she is working a shift on the volunteer crisis hotline, which she states may be discontinued due to lack of funding if only because the effectiveness of the hotline cannot be measured. While Malloy and Reed are there, Kathy receives a call from a girl calling herself Sheri, who has called a few times already. Distraught, she announces that she has just taken a handful of pills to commit suicide. Malloy and Reed have to work with what little information Sheri has told Kathy in past calls to try and find her before she dies from the overdose. Adam-12 arrives at a scene in Chinatown where a young man was beaten. He is an undercover officer working on Chinese gang problems. A young lady briefly appears but runs off before talking. A report is taken at a department store where a woman's purse was stolen while she was in a bathroom stall. They accompany her to her house where they catch the thief, a man. Reed is asked to report to the hospital where they believe the young woman has reappeared but her uncle refuses to let her talk. The next day they are asked to help bust counterfeiters where the same burglar from the day before had stolen counterfeit money and then caught passing it. They spot a man driving erratically thinking he is drunk. However, A lit joint in his pocket gives him away when it burns him. Reed receives a call from the young woman reporting an attack by the gang on the older Chinese organization. They and the gang squads arrive as the shooting starts. While on break Malloy and Reed learn that an old "friend" Jennings Thornton is back. He likes to play cop - a cop Buff. First call is to a store where a young inexperienced clerk had an expensive ring swapped for a cheap one. This is followed by their "friend" Thorton calling in a drunk driver he encountered. A call about a robbery at a store results in a shootout in the parking lot but the shooter has a flak jacket. Thorton runs down the shooter with his car to end it but putting Reed in danger . The officers take a call at a parking lot where a minor accident has occurred. The woman has no ID and appears to be the woman who stole the ring. They arrest her but the clerk cannot identify her. They receive another call where Thorton used a gun to arrest two young men for stealing mag wheels. However, they were the legal owners of the wheels and the roles are reversed with Thorton under arrest. Mac arrives to say they found the ring on the woman at Central Booking making for a very good day. On a Saturday night they start with a man pulled over for a possible DUI but he passes the sobriety tests. When they noticed an oddly parked car, they start to investigate but hear shouts from a nearby house followed by three gunshots. They find the owner has killed his ex-son-in-law who invaded his house after being released recently from jail. A report of car strippers turns up a single man stripping a car. A stopped speeder says he has forgotten his wallet and license but the car has over $900 of outstanding traffic tickets. Malloy pulls a bluff to force the man to give his real name. The shift closes with two robberies/beatings at motels. While on patrol, Malloy and Reed hear gunshots fired at a service station followed by a car speeding out of the station. In pursuit, they are able to stop the vehicle and apprehend the driver. He, however, feigns innocence in the shooting. Taking him back to the service station, they find that this situation ends up being somewhat of a victimless crime. Next, they are called to a residential noise complaint, the noise from a lion. Upon their arrival, they find that the "lion" is somewhat harmless, except as a noise issue, and that another tactic instead of a lion may better serve its "owner". They are then called to a domestic dispute, one that only a divorce lawyer can handle. However, the wife, who wants her husband arrested in the meantime, decides to take matters into her own hands, her action which doesn't have quite the effect she was hoping. While on patrol, they encounter a speeding vehicle, the driver of which they learn was involved in an armed robbery at a liquor store. The robber is able to barricade himself inside a garage of a house. Reed comes across a way to get in to apprehend the robber. Through all these calls, what is first and foremost on both Reed and Malloy's mind is what was supposed to be Reed's top secret task for Mac: to write a profile article about Malloy for "Police Beat" magazine to celebrate his tenth anniversary on the job. Reed's scout friend with a merit badge in electronics comes in to pick up Reed's TV to repair it but unexpectedly takes it apart at the station. The other officers are skeptical he can repair it. On patrol they receive a call about motorcycle racing on the streets. It is a juvenile on a souped up minibike who forces them to pursue him. He is living with an aunt after his parents were killed and has no friends. A neighbor calls and reports he overheard his neighbors arguing and saw the wife digging in her backyard the night before and the husband is now missing. The woman is raising chickens in the house and one named after her husband who has left died and she buried the chicken. A radio call reports a tall blonde woman with a big purse held up a store. Reed spots her at a bus stop minus wig and high-heeled shoes. Picketing at a store is resolved when the lead picketer learns she met the store manager on a computer date the previous night. He said he was a test pilot and she stalks off ending the issue. Malloy and Reed take a report on a robbery at a restaurant where two men were shot. They quickly recognize that the people making the report are the actual robbers. Reed's TV is fixed but the scout had to call a TV repairman for some minor help. Mac has a problem. Malloy's landlady who is a feisty little old lady had her purse stolen by a red headed boy. She refuses to leave the station until her case is solved. While on patrol they spot a car that seems to be acting strange. When Malloy circles around on it, the car rabbits and the two men are arrested after a car chase for reckless driving and heroin found in the car. At the station Mrs. O'Brien is hounding the detectives. Malloy after studying a rash of similar thefts suggests using a decoy to test his theory. He believes they are stealing women's Social Security checks when they leave the Post Office. A patrol call takes them to a house where a woman has reported that her husband has killed their son with a shovel. Reid notices tire tracks and wads of paper at the scene as they arrest the husband. Malloy and Reid are called back to the station to handle a picket line created by Mrs. O'Brien and her friends. While there Mac talks to Reid about the murder and Reid realizes the candy wrappers and tire tracks belonged to the two men they picked up earlier. Next day Mac allows Malloy and Reid along with a police woman to try the decoy idea resulting in the arrest of the red headed boy and cracking the rest of the ring. After their shift Malloy is to drop off his car with a mechanic and Reed is to pick him up but Malloy is hijacked by a man and woman after leaving the station. They want her boyfriend released from jail in return for Malloy. When they have him verify they have him, Malloy gives a clue to his whereabouts by giving a name of a girl the officers found with a mannequin. Reed finds Malloy's car and a girl nearby gives a description of the people and car that took Malloy. They find the car abandoned. Reed's investigation of their cases turns up the girl's name and location which Reed stakes out. Malloy has spilled gasoline in the house where he is held and is able to swipe a lighter and set it afire allowing him to jump out the window where Reed sees the smoke and hears the gunfire. Malloy and Reed are at a crime scene in the hills where another girl has been found raped and dumped but this time she is alive. Her account includes the fact that a red sports car was involved. Later, they see a red Porshe pick up a young girl and the car tries to escape when they signal it to stop. The car stops and dumps the girl. Malloy continues the chase alone but loses the car. He finds a red Porshe but the girl says the owner is not the man. A call to a robbery at a lumber yard has unexpected aid from police scouts who collar one of the two men. Reed captures the second man in a shootout. The mother of the young girl calls the officers when she finds drugs in her daughter's laundry. She is selling drugs and the man they had her identify is her supplier. The officers experience radio problems delaying their deployment and causing Mac to reprimand them. Lately this has become a issue between him and all the officers. A call at a store being robbed has a woman taken hostage and to the roof. The officers are held off with gunfire but when they move to a different roof the hostage is left behind when she doesn't complete a jump between roofs. The officers rescue her and with the aid of Air 10 track the suspects and capture them. At the station Mac talks to Pete about a conversation with his wife. She has opened an antique shop and it is taking her time which Mac does not like putting a strain on their marriage. A call about a runaway elderly woman has her husband mad because his wife goes to a pizza restaurant to listen to a piano player there. Mac arrives at the restaurant to ask Pete to pick up his kids and overhears an orderly who arrives. He states the couple has been married for sixty years but the husband can't understand his wife desire for private time occasionally forcing Mac to understand the problem with his wife. Malloy stops to drop off laundry before shift. While there the manager confronts a young man tying up a dryer. Malloy arrrests him for drying marijuana. On shift they take a call about a fight where a divinity student is fighting men over taking the Lord's name in vain. A bus driver reports a young girl left on his bus. They take her to the station as she does not speak english. By trial and error they learn she in from Finland. They take her to back track her route to find her relative's home. When they return her, they have to handle a neighbor dispute across the street where a man's boys are trashing his neighbor's property again. The laundry manager reports a man and woman looking for their friend. The police use the license plate of their car to track down the people. Malloy purses the girl in the car while Reed must handle the man on foot. Back at the laundromat, Reed learns Malloy was dropping off his laundry plus his girlfriend's. Woods is acting as trainer for Don Allen, who is still in the academy and who will be riding with Woods as his partner in Xray-14. Malloy and Reed's first impression about Allen is that he is competent, but nervous, those nerves which may or may not cause problems in the field. If those problems do manifest themselves, they will be in high pressure situations. Adam-12's first call takes them to a dispute between a landlord and a possible tenant, who was working through the landlord's broker. Only the broker may be able to clear up whether the landlord or tenant, if either, is in the wrong in this situation. Next, they are called to a pharmacy where a silent alarm went off. Malloy and Reed will learn that the pharmacist has an effective manner in dealing with armed robbers, his routine which usually results in him coming ahead in the situation. Finally, they are called to back-up Xray-14 in an armed robbery in progress. This call is only the latest that Malloy and Reed encounter Xray-14 during this shift. This last call in particular shows if Allen has what it takes to be a police officer. Something which Allen divulges about himself following this call may provide that answer. The officers are on patrol in a section of town made up heavily of retired people. As they start patrol they spot a man who stole a purse being chased by an oriental woman in her car in a cemetery. The man escapes over a wall. George,a retired officer who works private security flags them down primarily to talk. While driving they spot an elderly man trying to break into a car in a church parking lot. The minister wants to let him go but he has multiple outstanding felony warrants for auto theft. As they stop at a restaurant, they spot a commotion across the street. An elder woman is claiming an elder man made an indecent proposal but the apartment manager explains the woman is being evicted and the man says he offered to let her stay at his place. The woman states her son will pick her up but while eating the officers see her smashing their windshield with a hammer so they have to take her in. While patrolling the park, they settle an argument between two men about a five dollar bill and rescue a baby stroller rolling into the lake. They spot the man they chased in the cemetery at a church. They close out the day with an arrest assisted by George who admits he is lonely as his friends have passed. When an officer calls for help but fails to give his name or location, it results in a frantic search for the missing officer. The dispatcher helps by doing a roll call of all the known officers on patrol at the time of the call, while Reed and Malloy assist in the search. A motorcycle officer is the one who is missing, eventually leading their comrades to a parking garage and an armed hostage situation. Much of Malloy and Reed's current on-patrol social chat centers around Malloy's latest date with a flight attendant, and when the Reeds will be able to meet her. Their first call takes them to a bar, where a woman is wielding a gun. When they arrive, they learn that this time is not the first the woman, a regular customer, has pulled the gun before, but why this time is the first the the police have been notified. At their next call, they meet a man who was ambushed in his car by four young men, who stole his car. Malloy and Reed hope to get enough information from the victim, who is more belligerent about police not doing enough to protect him. He is eventually able to provide some information, including that the men were wearing urban cowboy gear and their car was out of state. Malloy has a theory that the perpetrators targeted the victim for what they knew was in his trunk: guns. Not before the perpetrators are able to strike again, this time armed, Malloy and Reed are able to follow more evidence, including the fact the the perpetrators seem to be more concerned with themselves than being smart. They decide to play a hunch to see if it will lead to finding the men before they actually use the guns to kill. One other call they attend to is the electrocution death of a man in his bathtub. The ambulance driver on the scene believes that the victim's grieving widow knows more than she lets on. On Reed's suggestion, Mac arranges for him and Malloy to spend a few days on air patrol so that they can get a feel for what air patrol can or cannot do in assisting ground patrol. If this pilot test is successful, other ground units may also take shifts up in the air, much to some officer's chagrin. Upon their arrival at the helicopter station, they learn that they will be in the air with an old ground patrol friend, Officer Lou Walters, and Officer Chet Mills. Their first call is a heist at a wholesale jewelers located in a high rise complex downtown, the perpetrators still somewhere in the building. Malloy wonders if they can not only patrol the exterior of the building, such as the roof, but also do visual checks in windows. He soon gets his answer. They are then asked to assist in a ground patrol call in an apparent homicide, where the perpetrator left the scene in an identified vehicle. Air patrol takes up the search for that car, based partly on some past information Malloy is able to provide. Just as they land for their meal break, they are called back up into the air, this time in two 'copters, to pursue a stolen light plane that almost collided mid air with an incoming Boeing 727 at Burbank Airport. However, before the two units can pursue the stolen plane, they first have to locate the stolen plane, with only the vector from air traffic control providing a general direction. The rest has to be done visually. Continuing with their air patrol shift, Reed with Mills and Malloy with Walters, they are still pursuing the light plane that was stolen from Burbank Airport. They have to coerce the pilot, who had a few drinks prior to stealing the plane and is suicidal over a failing long term marriage, to land the plane safely without injuring anyone. Next, the two air units pursue two different vehicles that were involved in a robbery. Malloy and Reed learn that more than one 'copter per pursuit may cause problems. On what is supposed to be their second and final air shift, Malloy is called back to ground patrol leaving Reed to cover the air, this time with Walters. Late into that shift in the evening, Reed and Walters can smell a fire, which they have to locate. They can use their position in the air for mass evacuation purposes if the fire gets out of hand. By the end of the shift, Reed will have a lengthy report of what measures can be taken to improve not only cooperation between air and ground, but also to assist air in doing their own job more effectively. Reed and Malloy arrest Sparky a known drug user and thief when they suspect she is high. However, Sgt. Hardwicke tells Reed his case is too weak which turns out to be true. Mac tells Reed about a new program for officers to work alternate duty for 30 days to gain experience. Reed opts to join the vice squad with Hardwicke. It involves new training and a lifestyle that causes friction with his wife due to irregular hours and his environment. He quickly learns the job is dirty due to the type of crime. They bust a a man giving drugs to young boys in return for pictures of them. Malloy is paired with Officer Woods handling the usual calls including one where a woman has disarmed the criminal. Hardwicke follows up by having Reed use his connection with Sparky to have her provide details on two men who rob other dealers and fence goods. During the take down of the men Malloy is wounded. Malloy returns to duty after recovering from being shot. The manager of a typing school states only money was taken but it appears that typewriters were also stolen. They suspect the school has been buying stolen equipment. The officers research thefts but believe the stolen goods are being moved across country to cover their source. They handle a break-in at a warehouse where a girl and boy knock out the guard and shoot at the officers. The girl is sixteen and daughter of the warehouse owner who tries to persuade Malloy and Reed to free the kids. Mac gives them a hot sheet of serial numbers for typewriters. When they stop at the school an assistant is there who unknowingly allows them to check the typewriters which are stolen. Jim has a fight with his wife over the dangers of his job but at the last minute she decides to attend the ceremony when Jim receives the Medal of Valor. As patrol begins they take a call about a disturbance in a park. An artist is being accosted by an elderly woman who believes one of his paintings is indecent. She eventually leaves but Malloy decides to buy the painting when they determine he needs a new permit to sell in the park and is short on money. While patrolling they notice a fight in front of a store. A man is trying to retrieve an expensive coin his soon put into a nickel toy dispenser and the store owner thought he was trying to steal the money in it. A woman reports a person using a telescope in the neighborhood to look at homes. The men determine the person is a woman herself reading meters to avoid dogs, etc and she is a very liberated woman. A call about a disturbance reveals a man trying to widen the door to a house to repossess furniture he sold on a payment plan but he himself is despised by the neighborhood. A call about an unsuccessful robbery at a bar reveals an ex-football player drinking and pulling holdups. A second call indicates he has pulled a robbery at the Colisium where they have a shootout before capturing him. The officers are on loan to LAX airport. The first case is a man taking a stewardess hostage because he wants a job with a specific film director in LA. They convince the man that the director is on the phone to distract him. The police are given a tip by another police department that a shipment of drugs is arriving in a suitcase. They tail the suitcase and arrest a group of men making separate drug pickups at the airport leading to a huge bust. Final call is a woman who is picked up by man posing as a limo driver. He pistol whips, robs and dumps her but she tears his shirt. They find the car and a tip leads them to the suspect in the airport. Mac tells the officers to be on the lookout for a man with a green Pinto who is going to commit suicide. An apartment manager finds a baby in a trash can forcing the officers to track down the mother. They track her down via the clinic where the baby was born and learn she is a drug addict. A woman spots five men stripping a car. She has the license number of their truck but tells the officer they are returning to complete the job allowing the officers to arrest the men. They find the green Pinto and with Malloy talking to the man and Reed coming in from the adjoining room they are able to stop him. After a weekend break during an Indian summer, Reed returns to work with a problem: he has a sunburn, even on the tops of his feet, as he fell asleep outside. While Reed, who decides to do regular patrol rather than request desk duty, does whatever he can to avoid sun exposure, Malloy, being the good partner that he is, tries to accommodate Reed whenever he can without compromising their work. While on patrol, they are alerted to a fender bender where one of the vehicles is on fire. They are most concerned with the personal safety of the two drivers involved, one who is unconscious behind the wheel. After their lunch break which Reed uses to recuperate from the burn, they pull over a driver whose turn cut off a pedestrian in a crosswalk. The discussion with the driver doesn't do Reed any good with regard to forgetting about his burn. Next, they are clandestinely flagged down by Charlie, one of their snitches, who tells them about what he believes is excessive drug use in an abandoned house, which leads them to believe there is a drug dealer in the neighborhood. Charlie keeping his ears and eyes open may provide information about where the dealer is located. They are then notified about a jewelry store hold-up, where the perpetrator got away but whose getaway vehicle was identified. They and the other patrol units go looking for that car. And while patrolling through the park, they are flagged down by a woman who tells them of a capsized boat in the lake. She believes there were two boys aboard who have not surfaced. Beyond the seriousness of the situation, Reed takes the opportunity to assist in his own burn situation by being the one to go swimming for the boys. Malloy is contacted by Charlie Bishop who has served his time and is having a hard time adjusting to life on the outside. After listening to Charlie's story Malloy and Reed go back out on patrol, and after catching a potential tax cheat they check out a halfway house in hope that it has room for Charlie. In the meantime Charlie has decided that he'd rather be back in prison and after receiving a radio call Malloy and Reed realize they have to stop him from making a big mistake. After an off night at the shooting range, Reed leaves work and stops at an all night grocery. As he is leaving with both arms full of groceries, a young man approaches as if he knows Reed. He points out a friend in a green Volkswagon Beetle holding a pistol on Reed. Reed drops the groceries, pushes the young man, leaps, and fires at the car hitting it. The man in the car fires hitting his friend. The grocer heard only one shot as he comes out of the store, the car races off, and the young man hit in the head makes a dying declaration that Reed was gun happy and shot him. Reed is on desk duty until a review board clears him but the young man dies increasing the pressure on Reed. Malloy with a new by the book partner spends time on and off duty running license plate number combinations looking for the green Beetle. Reed's sprained wrist puts him on office duty while Malloy has a new partner on his first day on the job. Malloy trains the rookie in the basics of the job to make him more effective. Reed is handling miscellaneous questions on the phone and people coming in in person. He receives a call about a bomb threat at the station forcing a search of the entire facility. Officer Brinkman adds excitement by accidentally discharging a shotgun outside - twice. A young man wants to report possible misconduct by an officer while an elderly man brings in a shotgun to leave causing excitement until the officers determine what he is doing. Malloy brings in children abandoned by their mother and must tell the oldest son what has happened. Malloy and his new partner go into pursuit of a car they spot. They lose the car when it turns into the police parking lot and the occupants are arrested. With the new team work concept the officers are helping each other. Malloy and Reed complete a home survey to improve the security of the house. When the owner recommends the officers check her son's room, he is embarrassed by a poster of a pig as a police officer on the wall. They handle the investigation of a traffic accident along with Officer Grant. Malloy is suspicious when a driver states a female witness gave him the name of an attorney to call. A hot dog stand owner complains about illegally parked cars at his new stand. They tell him he needs proper signs as he did at his previous place. They report their suspicions about the woman at the accident to the detectives. While at the station the boy with the poster comes by to apologize and say he is part of a neighborhood watch. Officer Grant tells them Officer Woods is handling another accident and the same woman is there. They confront her at the accident where she is again a witness. After the driver talks, she is arrested. They are called back to the hot dog stand where the owner now has proper signs. They are asked along with Officer Grant to go on plain clothes duty to catch a burglar at a stakeout. After a chase they catch the man but the boy is there as well observing and in danger. Reed can't think about much beyond Malloy paying off his lost bet to him, the payoff a nice French dinner out for him and his wife. Malloy, on the other hand, would rather forget the entire bet. But first, they will have to deal with two calls where some of the supposed victims in question are less than cooperative. First, they are called to an upscale home, where the maid reports a missing seven-month old infant. But when the homeowners, the Wilkinsons, arrive home, they, acting suspiciously, tell Malloy and Reed that the infant is with its grandmother. And second, they are called to a home with a suspected prowler. Upon their arrival, they do find a man outside trying to get into the home, but the young mother inside, who is also acting suspiciously, says the supposed prowler is indeed a man she knows. Malloy and Reed just hope that the two sets of victims will voluntarily come forward with whatever they are hiding. Next, they deal with a theft at a college's football team locker room. The robbers ransacked the medicine cabinet, which the trainer states was filled solely with vitamins. But the trainer also admits that he really has no idea what was in the medicine cabinet as he is told by the team doctor and coach which pills to administer to players, without he knowing what those pills are. Only the coach and doctor in question can answer if there was more in the cabinet than just vitamins. The robber may have motives other than personal use or sale of the drugs. And while on patrol, they notice one muscle car seemingly chasing another, which leads to their vehicle being added to the high speed pursuit. After all is said and done, the thought of a rich and out of the ordinary French dinner may be more appealing in theory than practice. The officers are assigned a replacement car for one shift. However it has only 300 miles to go before it is retired and has the usual problems to go with its age. The car surges and the glove compartment door keeps opening onto Reed's knees. While on patrol Reed spots a young woman hot wiring a car. A second call is about a man snooping around a house. The radiator bursts a hose and sprays steam as they try to sneak up on the man who, it turns out, used to live there. After a broken water hose is replaced, the men pull over a man for no tail lights. Luckily they don't give him a ticket as he points out they have no tail lights. A neighbor to a warehouse calls in a report of men loading items at the warehouse for the first time in eight years at night. After investigating the officers call for backup to arrest the thieves. Upon returning to patrol Malloy makes Reed drive but when they receive a call the car dies due to cracked distributor cap. Once back on patrol again they go in pursuit of a wanted car capturing the driver but the emergency brake on their car malfunctions resulting in the car crashing into a tree. While eating at a restaurant, the waitress notices that the man who came in is carrying a gun. They check him out and find he is a private investigator from out of state without a valid license to carry. They escort him to his car to stow the gun. Their first call is from an elderly man who dislikes hippies and the man wants the police to issue parking tickets to their cars illegally parked on the street. A call about a fight in a parking lot finds the same PI standing over a young black man he has hit. The PI's story is that the young man and his partner tried to rob him. The boy is taken to the hospital with a concussion. A woman flags the officers down and in an unusual occurrence asks for a ticket due to the bald tires that her husband will not replace on her car. The second youth in the scuffle comes in to Mac and tells a different story backed up by the boy in the hospital. Mac says to arrest the PI who they trace to an apartment where he has caught the bail jumper but roughed him up. Officer Art McCall returns to the force after eight years on disability. He rides with Malloy and Reed learning changes since he left the force. They start with a young woman whose ex-husband has returned from prison and she feels threatened. McCall wants to resort to old techniques that are no longer allowed. After a juvenile robbery bust, they are forced to release the boy captured by Art who did not read the boy his rights. He fumbles the arrest of the ex-husband carrying a gun. After being released, the ex-husband plants a bomb in the woman's car. Malloy is forced to have a frank discussion with Art about his inability to adjust to the changes in law enforcement policy. The first call is to catch a man nicknamed the "Ferret" who is damaging a manufacturing company. He out runs Reed, and the newspaper reporter on the scene delights in the story. When they respond to an intruder call they find a man going house to house who flags them down for help. His wife is comatose and about to have a baby. They take the couple to the hospital where the doctor asks them to check for mud the woman has been eating. They find the mud and follow up with a visit to a voodoo priest who had ordered the mud for the couple. He puts a mojo hex on Reed which is followed by Mac showing them the paper with Reed on the front page. They pull an elderly lady over for erratic driving and she takes them for gas station attendants. When they go to the manufacturing company to check recently fired employees for the ferret, he shows up at the office and this time Reed is able to catch him. A drug addict robs a store run by elderly women selling small items they make by sewing things such as pot holders and doilies. They spot a convertible with three men just after they are reported on the radio to have held up a store. A pursuit takes place and, together with Mac, arrest the three men. Later a nearby antique shop is held up by someone with a similar description to the first robber. He asked for a limited amount of money and a later call back to the first shop indicates he returned the money stolen earlier. A car is spotted making a rolling stop at a stop sign but the driver is a priest looking for the police to arrest a man from whom he bought marijuana. They accompany him back to the dealer's apartment and make the arrest. The final call is back to the first store where the same addict is in the midst of another robbery. They capture him followed by Malloy secretly buying some doilies after having teased Reed for buying pot holders the previous day from the "grandmothers". A new very attractive clerk working at the station grabs Malloy's interest. The catch is that she is the niece of the over-protective Officer Ed Wells. When Malloy asks her out on a date, Ed drives Reed and Malloy crazy with his questions and rules. On patrol they are called about a prowler hiding in an overgrown yard. A man with a load of flowers and outstanding traffic warrants has the men helping him and in return creating some good will for the department. Ed tries to prevent Malloy's date but she sees through Ed. A traffic chase with a Corvette comes up short when the car disappears. Gardners at a house on the officers' vacation list results in stopping a burglary. A man found injured on the road is the Corvette driver who crashed off the road. Ed Wells' nerves take a shot when his niece has a date with a different officer who has been divorced three times and raves about his way with women. Malloy is given a tip that a young man he coaches is using heroin again. Malloy and the boy's parole officer work together to track down what is going on. Reed and Malloy respond to a hit and run where a small boy is hit and hurt severely. The boy thinks Reed is his father who was killed in Vietnam. A man blows a stop sign resulting in a traffic stop. He is given a ticket but his passenger is taken in for selling drugs. In reality he is an undercover officer trying to make a buy from the driver. Malloy is called by the parole officer to help take in the young man for using again. They learn he had bought some heroin but did not use it. However, they find his younger brother had. A call to a night club finds a singer, Kathy, strung out on drugs causing a disturbance. She finds security with Reed who rides with her to the hospital. She tells him someone is trying to kill her and giving her drugs. Narcotics believes she can provide a lead to new drugs and ask Reed to go undercover with Kathy as a soldier AWOL with a big cache of heroin to sell. He agrees and although he makes a deal, the girl burns him under pressure. The narcotics squad lose Reed but Malloy arrives as the dealers are trying to kill Reed and Kathy. On patrol they encounter a squad car that is deserted and they have not heard any officer announce stopping there. When they check it out, they find that a lone officer saw a hitchhiker and had chased him down with a bag of stolen items. During roll call the officers are told to be on the lookout for the radical Robin Saydo who has ties to bombings. The department wants him trailed but not picked up. Malloy receives a call from retired security officer Fred Tibbles who works on the docks and is being forced to overlook thefts. They come upon a truck driver who was knocked out and his load of pantyhose stolen. Tibbles calls with a tip about a heist to take place that afternoon and one earlier. Malloy realizes the trucks being hijacked are being taken for the trucks and not their loads. In a stakeout and pursuit with a police chopper, they become involved in a shootout but break the ring. Reed spots the radical on the streets. They trail him to a building where the DA decides to arrest him and make a search for weapons, etc. At the start of the shift the officers receive their car back after routine maintenance. They find, however, that the radio mike has problems and they have to repeat calls. The pair is called to a robbery in progress. Reed captures one suspect at the store while Malloy goes in pursuit of the second suspect through a city park on a winding street at night. However only some of his radio calls are being received, including his position. Malloy loses control of the car and goes off the road, rolling the car. His position is hidden from the road and he is severely injured with internal injuries and a broken leg. He comes to and splints his leg with a shotgun. He hears the search on the radio but they miss him, the search is moved to a new location but Reed who resists moving out of the park. A man hiding from from the police for a murder he committed watches Malloy and finally comes to him but instead of helping steals the shotgun, his pistol, and rips the microphone off the cord leaving the wires exposed. Malloy then uses the exposed wires to signal for help which Reed picks up as he is still in the park. Shift starts at roll call where Mac announces a chain of robberies using milk crates to break store windows. It is Pete's birthday and he tells Reed he doesn't want a surprise party. On patrol they receive a call to backup another car on a jewelry story break-in but are interrupted by a DUI who turns out to be the jewelry store owner called by the police. They handle a call from an embarrassed man whose leather shoulder purse is stolen while buying a negligee. They spot a man working at a closed gas station and find he has the wrong uniform resulting in a arrest. They pull over a car for dangerous passing. The driver has an outstanding warrant but Reed notices a milk cartoon in the back seat and secretly marks it thinking he is the thieve mentioned at roll call. They return to the station where Malloy continues to see hints of a surprise birthday party for him despite Reed's denials. Shots in the police garage results in a major shootout with a good natured drunk an officer decided not to handcuff. Shift ends with Wells saying they made an easy bust of a guy breaking in and drinking alcohol he finds on site at a location that Malloy had been wanting to patrol based on a hunch. However, his hunch about the surprise party turns out to be wrong but Reed's marked milk cartoon leads to the capture of the thief with the goods. Reed gives Malloy a birthday present - a leather purse. Malloy returns from a Sunday off with Woods fishing. A call at the start of patrol is about an elderly lady with poor memory who frequents a store but says her poltergeist is the one who creates accidents. The owner knows her but cannot reach her daughter to pick her up and pay for damages. The officers take her in but "her poltergeist" spills a large bottle of perfume in the back seat of the squad car. They must put up with the smell for the entire shift despite numerous trips to the garage to see Tony the mechanic. While on patrol they notice a woman who can't speak trying to ask for help. She writes that a man entered the church via a window and they spot a man emptying the safe. Officer Jerry Woods is the backup and identifies the man as the pastor who forgot his id and keys. The pastor is glad to see Gerard and says they have missed him on Sundays. Gerard states he had to work Sundays and Malloy backs him up saying "they were in the same boat yesterday". A kidnapping call turns out to be a man picking up the daughter of a neighbor who is a drunk to take her to her grandmother. A young boy flags them down to report a big boy stole his bike and his friends are chasing him. They patrol the neighborhood until they spot the person being held down by the young boy's friends. They are on a stake out for an armored truck robbery but the thieves make a clean escape. A call to the bus station about a potential rattlesnake in a suitcase turns out to be an electric toothbrush. They make contact with their source T.J. about the robberies and he a provides a few extra details as to where he overheard the threat. A call to the same bar puts them onto a man they suspect might be involved but with no proof. Malloy develops a theory on how the robberies are committed involving the sewer system. They plan a stakeout based on Malloy's theory which they execute with success. Reed and Malloy spot an open back door to store on night patrol. When they investigate it, a car suddenly leaves the alley as they enter the shop. Malloy steps on a rug, setting off a buzzer, and the store owner comes out brandishing a rifle. It appears the owner was waiting for someone in ambush. They report it to Mac who passes it on to the detectives. He reports back the store owner has a clean sheet and came to the country 17 years earlier from Eastern Europe. They decide to talk to a local priest who knows the store owner. When the owner hears this, he complains to Mac. Next day the men handle a call from a woman with a drunk man in her car. He had been buying her drinks at the bar there. Later, they receive a report of shots at the store and arrive to find an intruder knocked out on the floor and no one else there. They visit the priest who has the owner in his office. The intruder was a man who worked with the Nazis in Europe and did not want to be turned in. The opening scene shows a traffic stop of two suspected armed robbers gone tragically wrong; pull back to see that it is actually a training exercise at the police academy. Later, one of the rookie officers who was at the demonstration - Officer George Barrett - bungles the arrest of an elderly man suspected of robbing the bank. Malloy and Wells are upset with Barrett for his reluctance to go through the proper procedures in arresting the man, even though he appeared harmless (the suspect did not display a weapon and merely presented a note requesting $1 million). Later, Mac, Malloy and Reed talk about what happened, with Mac noting that this is another in a growing series of Barrett's serious mistakes and that he seems unwilling to learn or take good advice. Later, the officers are called to a grocery store, where a madman has planted an explosive device inside a cereal box, and the bomb will detonate within the hour. The officers eventually corner the suspect, who holds another man at gunpoint. Tracking the suspect and hostage into a storeroom and disabling the suspect, Reed (who noticed that the suspect wasn't paying attention to his prisoner) orders Barrett to arrest the hostage, but Barrett hesitates to do so. Malloy completes the arrest before the "hostage" can do anything. In the closing tag, Mac informs Reed and Malloy that "Barrett's through" (i.e., the process to fire him for his repeated mistakes has been started). He then reiterates the purpose of probation: a proving period to determine whether a new officer will perform well under pressure and has the skills needed to be a good policeman. The officers are in a driver refresher course where their driving skills are honed and tested. The department wants to prevent patrol car accidents. Officer Wells has proposed a new strategy to deal with the theft of car accessories that they put into action on their return to duty. They ride bicycles as paperboys to prevent the thieves hiding from the police on patrol by laying down on the sidewalk side of the car. Malloy encounters an irate customer thinking he is her paperboy but the strategy works. However, Officer Wells wrecks his bicycle and has to explain it to the little girl who owns it. Reed hounds Malloy to drive now that they have gone through driving school but Malloy won't give up the wheel. They pull over a man in a VW bus who rails on the police tactics. However, he is carrying a parrot that says "Down with the pigs." Malloy gives the man a warning and both officers have a laugh about it. A call to a break-in at an auto dealership leads to a high speed chase. Malloy backs off on the chase when they think the man is cornered but the man wraps the car around a tree. While on patrol, Reed stops into the local bank to pay a loan - and walks right into a bank robbery. Two hardened criminals with nothing to lose learn that Reed is a police officer and decide to take him hostage as a bargaining tool. Malloy and Mac are forced to come up with a drastic way to save Reed's life and foil the criminals. Two boys break into a garage. Truants have become a big problem in terms of crime and Reed has a plan he wants approved to pick up truants on the street. While patrolling, they come upon a stalled car they help off the street. Malloy receives a message to hold the car and occupants under arrest. They are smuggling heroin in the gas tank and some leaked stalling the car. They spot a stolen car which leads them to the thieves who stripped the car to build a dune buggy. Reed's plan is approved but initially the other officers are unhappy playing babysitter. A pair of truants are spotted and picked up as a call comes in about a nearby theft. The lady identifies the two truants as the thieves and they are caught with the goods. The results show massive reduction in crime and happier officers. However, as Reed envisions stopping juvenile crime, one of the boys from the first call whose mother did not see her son as a problem is brought into the station again. Malloy returns from vacation sporting a mustache bringing forth jokes from the coworkers. The officers spot a light plane on a glide path to crashing.

The story starts in the midst of a thunderstorm outside Finn and Jake's tree fort. Jake is telling a spooky tale about vampires, and Finn is shaken. Finn thinks he hears something at the window, and is afraid it might be vampires, but then Jake admits that story was made up. All of a sudden, the window opens, and Marceline the Vampire Queen makes her entrance. She is friendly, but scary, assuring Finn and Jake that she usually only sucks the color red out of things, rather than blood. She entertains Finn and Jake with tales of her adventures. But after that, she claims that the tree fort belongs to her, and kicks out Finn and Jake. The boy and dog go hunting for a new home, but everywhere they look, someone else already lives there. Finally they arrive at a deserted cave, and turn it into a pleasant living space.

All the princesses of Ooo aren't all there when they come to Finn and Jake for help. That's because someone has been going around stealing princess parts! They'd practically give their arms and legs to get their arms and legs back.

They foil the Agents' plan by finding the real mummy and returning King Fuad to his people. This time The Hacker is targeting the Sphinx during Napoleon's occupation of Egypt. To their surprise the Adventurers discover that Prof. Krupnik is captive in a virtual prison inside the Sphinx. For the first time they meet The Hacker and realize that he has prepared his final and most vicious blow to disrupt history. The kids and Krupnik narrowly escape The Hacker's attempt to send them back to the Ice Age and only have minutes to prevent the Sphinx from being blown up. Worst of all their only way home is still on the Sphinx and the clock is ticking. It's the late 19th Century and the Adventurers board "Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show" train. Also traveling on the train is Grand Duke Alexis who plays a major role in Russia's sale of Alaska - The Hacker has sent his Agents to stop the sale. The Agents are close to demolishing the train in an explosion. With the help of Buffalo Bill and Annie Oakley, the Adventurers are able to rescue the Grand Duke's life and secure the future. On South African Safari with Ray Bunney each week, Adventures Abroad shoots the biggest, most dangerous game on the planet. Most people die to go on the hunts Ray takes while traveling the globe. Ray Bunney is a diehard over-the-top hunter with a tremendous amount of past experience. He will soon take his eighth African tour, plus he hunts nearly every destination in the world. Kudu, Rhino, Elephant, Lion, Waterbuck, Eland, and Cape Buffalo are only a short list of the huge variety of African animals offered in the upcoming season. Beautiful scenery and incredible images make Adventures Abroad comparable to any show on the Discovery Channel. Follows the adventures of eleven-year-old Zach Nichols and ten-year-old Annie Redfeather as they suffer pain from issues involving other children. To solve these problems, they seek council from a group of anthropomorphic animals whose names come from the Greek - Plato, an old and scholarly bison; Aurora, a wise red-tailed hawk; Socrates, a rambunctious and wisecracking bobcat; and Aristotle, a feisty and bookish prairie dog. This ensemble teaches the kids virtues by telling them stories from the Book of Virtues. Annie and Zach are saddened to see some families in town don't have any heat or warm clothes for the cold winter, and wish someone could help. Plato explains how anyone can make a difference and even tells them the story of how a monk's giving to those in need was enough reward for him throughout his life in "The Emerald Lizard". The two are eager to donate many clothes to the families who need them, and Annie is even willing to offer her favorite coat - but soon wishes she never had done that. Hoping to bring out the satisfaction for her that everyone should feel after giving, Plato tells the story "Mr. Straw", where a poor man felt wealth through generosity to others. Annie is disappointed that her family's vacation is postponed since her father has jury duty, and wonders why he simply doesn't skip it. Plato explains citizenship can reward good character, as shown in "The Stone in the Road" where those with and without it are repaid accordingly, and even if it doesn't, can make differences for the better, as the Roman Cincinnatus demonstrated by leading when and how he believed he must during war. Emile Zigrodny, a classmate Zach barely knows, loses his house in a fire, and Zach is hesitant to show him support since their first meeting would be his giving charity. Plato and the others try to push him in the right direction by pointing out that anyone can be kind since even the least-likely are capable of it as shown in the Biblical story "The Good Samaritan", anyone can make a difference no matter how young as shown in "The Legend of the Dipper", or how it proves to have lasting effects for the giver and the receiver as shown in "Androcles and the Lion". Even the poem "The New Colossus" shows what many hope America and all people should be to the needy. Annie is defeated badly by a formidable opponent in a hurdles race, and her confidence leaves her after that. Plato tries to help her get her it back by telling the story of "The Minatour", where an opportunity was taken to protect people in spite of the danger. When Zach acts confident, Ari points out to them both that different levels of courage are needed in different situations, as shown in Aesop's fable "The Brave Mice", and Plato speaks of William Tell, who put plenty at risk for his own sake and others'. Even the poem "If" is a reminder about how much courage life demands all in all. Zach and Annie go mountain-biking in the woods, but Zach's bike overturns and he sprains his ankle. Annie decides to stick with him since he can't walk or ride on it, and gets him not to think about their being stranded by retelling the Greek fable "Proetus" Plato told them, where a Greek king had to use all his willpower and strength to allow himself and his soldiers to return home. When Annie worries that they will have no chance of making their way out, Zach retells from Plato's collection the true story of Jinkswoitmaya, about a Native American who worked to save geologist explorer C.H. Claudy against seemingly-impossible odds from falling off an Alaskan mountain. Zach's first assignment for photographer as the school paper is, to his disappointment, taking pictures of things for the advertisements. He wants to quit, but Ari points out that every task has its ups and downs so the best solution is to work hard and cheerfully, as shown in "The Discontented Pig", and Michelangelo's refusal to shun any duty, from making snow-art when he knew it would melt to painting when his true talent was sculpting, made him famous for his work in the Sistine Chapel. Annie is saddened when her faith-devoted neighbor and friend Ruth passes away, and wonders whether faith is really wroth it because of that. Plato tries to convince her that it is very much worth it by telling the stories of the Hebrew Daniel in the lions' den, who looked to faith always and saw how times of trouble caused it to prove strong, and Harriet Tubman's determination to use faith to continue taking noble risks throughout her life. Even the 23rd Psalm is a good example of why there's enough reason for faith to live throughout life. Annie is disheartened when her recently-made friend Sarah decides to choose a partner other than her to go canoing with, even though she agreed to pair up with her, just because Annie's canoe leaks. Plato reads "Waukewa's Eagle" to show how compassion is occasionally and a good heart is always found in real friendships like that of a Maliseet boy and a bird. When Annie is ready to hold too much distrust against those from cities, Ari explains that friendship can take a lot of strength to build but it takes more to get through life without it by telling "Why Frog=child and Snake-child Never Play Together", where two creatures miss out on having a good friend. Plato reminds just how much true friendship is worth, as proved in "Damon and Pythias", where two best friends put ultimate trust in one another. Even the poem "New Friends and Old Friends" sets a good example of how long friendships should last. Plato learns that Annie and Zach are collecting canned goods for a homeless shelter, but their first priority is the rewards they'll get instead of helping the hungry, to the point where they argue over who should be recognized first at a celebration. He tries to explain how true giving requires selflessness, as shown in the story of "Rocking-Horse Land" where it's done between friends, and how it can be more satisfactory than receiving by telling "Old Man Rabbit's Thanksgiving Dinner". "The Gift of the Magi" is read as a reminder that even the thought of attempting to give something helps since it's the thought that counts. Even the poem "Count That Day Lost" is read as a reminder of exactly what giving, in any form, is worth in life. It's Zach's birthday and he wants to plan a large party to celebrate, but is bitter when his parents inform him they can only host a moderate one. Seeing this and how Ari is glum that his small size is why Sock won't let him do much to help set up an earlier celebration for Zach, Plato points out that what is actually had in life should not be easily scorned, as a man found out during his many experiences and longings in "The Discontented Stonecutter", and Aurora reminds that some things in life, like people, are worth more than ones that show wealth by reading "Cordelia's Jewels". Even the prayer "Father in Heaven, we thank thee" points out how much there is to be grateful for in life. Zach is sorely tempted to touch his dad's beautiful antique camera, despite promising not to - and when he does, he breaks it and lies that it fell off its display table naturally. Plato tries to convince Zach to tell the truth by telling him the stories of "The Frog Prince", where the title character received a punishment for breaking a promise and another had to keep one made, and the legend "George Washington and the Cherry Tree", whose protagonist too broke something he promised to leave in good shape but learned his lesson in a different way. Annie even tells a family tale of "The Indian Cinderella", where an Algonquin warrior only wished for an honest companion. Even the poem "Truth" shows how good it is and how much joy it can give through life. Zach feels triumphant when he gets a high enough grade on his history test to give him a good grade on his report card and make the honor roll, until he catches a mistake his teacher didn't. He is tempted to keep it secret so he'll be rewarded for his achievement, but Plato points out that the greatest honor, and reward, come from openness as shown in "The Honest Woodsman", and how even before he became famous as president Abraham "Honest Abe" Lincoln built a great reputation for himself by always attending to matters so small they would have been easy to ignore. Even Henry Watkins' poem "The Character of a Happy Life" reveals just how much true honor is worth. Annie is delighted to win the class presidency, but upon receiving it is pressed by her classmates to make what will be extreme, controversial changes and believes their proclamations that her greatness can accomplish anything. Plato warns her that a ruler's not swallowing pride often brings a painful fall to humiliation as proved in "The Emperor's New Clothes". On the other hand, "King Canute at the Seashore" is noted by Aurora as a reminder of how humility is a good thing for anybody but especially those trusted with power, but the mistakes made by a partly-noble youth who thought only of how he could display his brought widespread adversity in "Phaeton". Even the Serenity Prayer is a reminder of how much peace humility can bring. Annie gets more orders for her craft weathervanes with Plato, Aurora, Ari, and Sock on them than she can deliver right away, so rushes through some to sell them - then gets complaints about how they're dysfunctional. Plato encourages her to consider what the results of a rushed job show by telling "For Want of a Horseshoe Nail", where one incomplete task led to a remarkably high amount of trouble, and Aurora "Charlemagne and the Robber Knight", where an English king's and a lowly thief's thoughtfulness in how to deal with people proved life-saving. After giving himself too little time to work on a history fair project, Zach uses a model replica of an artifact his dad brought from Egypt to use on one on hieroglyphics, but grows embarrassed that it's fake so claims it's a real artifact, and concocts an elaborate story of how it was gotten. Annie is angry that he'll get as much acclaim as those, like her, who worked hard on theirs, while Ari is angry with Sock's reluctance to honor the deal they made about sharing their new intertube. Plato reminds them that dishonesty never truly pays off, as another found out in "The Boy Who Cried Wolf", where he wasn't believed even when he was truthful since he had a habit of lying. Zach doesn't think much of his football captain, and when Plato hears of Melanie's glory-lust which allows her to do as she pleases at the cost of the benefit of the team, he tells "The Tower to to the Moon" to demonstrate how a leader's self-importance was rewarded. Zach has a different reason to worry later when he himself is elected to do the job himself, and Plato tries to put his mind at ease by reading "The Gourdian Knot", to show how Alexander the Great proved the ability to think clearly was needed to lead, as well as another story about his putting others before himself through something as difficult as a dry desert trek. Zach enjoys birdwatching with Mr. Cleveland, but in climbing on a plaque to get up to a tree he breaks it and doesn't get why Mr. Cleveland is so worked up over it, especially when he shows confusion over why anyone would care about such an aged thing. Plato explains the meaning of one of the words on it, "loyalty", by telling the stories of "Yudisthira at Heaven's Gate", where a king is challenged to choose between a companion and his dreams, and "The Cap That Mother Made", where a boy is tempted with great things for something he values. When Plato remembers that the plaque was a war memorial and Zach remembers that Mr. Cleveland knew someone who died in World War II, Plato also brings up the story of the Jewess Persian queen Esther, who had to make the choice of risking life itself if she wished to save her own people. Even the poem "The Thousandth Man" shows how strong and great true loyalty is. Annie does her best in baseball and ends up leading her team tot he champion game, but then learns she's been spending too little time on schoolwork. Plato points out that being involved too much in something doesn't mean it brings rewards, as a creature learns in the African folktale "The Spider's Two Feasts" where determination to take much forced him to make a decision he didn't handle well. Sock gets into a situation like that of the title character in Aesop's "The Boy and the Nuts" when he tries to overdo the amount of Zach's report-card celebration cookies he claims, and Plato points out what And a farmer learns in "The Goose That Laid the Golden Egg": working too hard for something and not thinking of anything else proves disappointing. Annie volunteers to tutor a younger student in math, but grows openly frustrated with Josh when it doesn't turn out as easy as she hoped, then regrets her offer to help to begin with. Meanwhile, Ari is ready to quit trying to teach Sock to roller-skate. Plato tries to convince them that patience can make a difference, just like it did with another teacher, Anne Sullivan, who was forced to test every bit of hers to help her pupil, Helen Kellar. He also shows how using it enough to deal kindly with others brings satisfaction in "How the Brazilian Beetles Got Their Coats". Zach and Annie have been taking lessons in karate and guitar, respectively, but now decide they don't want to stay in them anymore. On a hike, Plato tries to remind them of how rewarding persistence can be by telling the stories of "Scarface", about a Native American warrior who was rewarded based on how hard he tried for something he wanted, and "The Stars in the Sky", where a girl learned how pleasing staying with a goal was afterward. A Greek hero's story in "Ulysses and Cyclops" proved how important tenacity is in times of trouble. Even the poem "You Mustn't Quit" shows how important perseverance is through life. Racing with Zach in the woods, Annie is quickly outrun and is unhappy enough about it to want to quit when she runs into Plato and the others. They remind her of another racer whose odds were against him but managed to win something even greater than a race when he persisted in "The Tortoise and the Hare". Zach and Annie are building a go-cart out of scraps from a friend's junkyard, but don't strike gold with every piece they find right away, and are ready to blame Jake Jeeters when he kicks them out after they yell at him. Plato hears their complaints and points out that manners are important in life, just as they are in the story "Please", the results for using and not using them are different by reading "Diamonds and Toads", and everyone and everything deserves respect as shown in the Italian story "The Bell of Atri". Annie agrees to put her brand-new bike to good use by delivering cakes from her mom's bakery, but can't resist Zach's offer to race - and is angry with him when her bike crashes and the food is ruined. Plato and Aurora try to convince her that responsibility is always handy to keep around as shown in "Icarus and Dedalus" where a boy had too little responsibility to obey his father and paid for it, or the legend "King Alfred and the Cakes" where even a renowned ruler was forced to admit he neglected his simple duty. Ari tells "The Chest of Broken Glass", where a mother reminds her family what rewards responsibility versus irresponsibility bring and how much can be owed to those in a family. Even the poem "If You Were" sums up what responsibility everyone has to humanity to make the world better. Zach offers Annie and all the others favors for money since he wants to buy a new game and can't get an allowance-raise at home. Plato points out that wanting money too badly leads to pain, as King Midas learned in "The Golden Touch". When Zach reveals that he said something hurtful to his mom, Aurora mentions how painful a short temper is for the one with the temper by telling "The King and His Hawk", where even Genghis Kahn didn't control his enough to not regret his actions later, and Plato reminds that waiting pays off, as shown in "The Magic Thread" where a boy learned that experiencing only the good moments in life didn't turn out as he expected. Even a set of Bible verses from Ecclesiates reminds that "To everything there is a season". Zach spends all his time playing an electronic game, so isn't ready for the Spring Valley Rangers camping trip since he hasn't read his manual. Embarrassed and frustrated, he goes off and runs into Sock, Aurora, Plato, and Ari. They hear about his situation and Ari reminds him that too much of a good thing can hurt if serious things aren't attended to, as shown in "The Dancing Horses of Sybaris", where a whole community put pleasure before work. Annie's enthusiasm about her family's upcoming spring vacation doesn't last when she learns her mother wants her to be a part-time sitter for her little cousins. Plato tries to explain how helping out can bring rewards, as shown in "The Line of Golden Light", or should at least bring joy, as it did to a knight in "St. George and the Dragon". Even the poem "Beautiful" reminds that the best kinds of people are those who give themselves to others. Zach is excited that a college football player who is his role model will attend his school pep rally, so volunteers to help out in order to meet him. But he doesn't think cleaning up for the assembly is worth it, and is prepared to go back on his word. Meanwhile, Sock is reluctant to help Ari find his misplaced glasses as promised because of his fear of tunnels. Plato explains that character is shown by letting actions compare to words as shown in "The Bear and the Travellers", where a badger learned of his companion's nature in a bad time, and in "The Knights of the Silver Shield" where one was rewarded based on his choices on how to see his job completed. Zach has graduated from elementary school and is about to start at middle school with more challenging work and new students, some of whom directly mislead him on Orientation Day, and is worried if he will succeed there. While Annie, remembering all the two have learned together, and the others encourage him, Plato reads "The Story of the Two Friends" to define wisdom by how a person lives out the positive characteristics within. A thunderstorm strikes the forest, knocking a tree into the rainbowl. Zach and Annie volunteer to clean it out, along with Plato, Ari, and Aurora, but Sock isn't interested in helping. Plato tells him the story "How the Camel Got His Hump", where another beast's how not working gave him trouble. When Sock agrees to help but complains of boredom, Plato tells "Tom Sawyer Gives Up the Brush", where it was learned that working is more enjoyable than laziness as long as the right viewpoint is there. Annie chooses to build an electric motor for her science project but has a tough time with it so is ready to quit. Plato reminds her of the Wright Brothers, who wanted to build a machine but had to put a lot of effort into making the first airplane. Historian and writer Dan Cruickshank celebrates architecture as a creative force as he explores the world's greatest cities, buildings and monuments. In the first episode, Cruickshank explores how humanity has created beauty through architecture. He travels to Greenland to build an igloo, creating an architectural form that is under threat due to climate change. In China he scales the world's biggest Buddha and deciphers a temple in India rich with erotic images. He visits the Catherine Palace, a hot-blooded baroque masterpiece in the middle of snowy Russia. Finally, he uncovers the dark tale of Albi Cathedral, a building originally designed to suppress the local population but now an object of beauty and wonder. Dan examines how architecture is designed to bring people together. The 1960 completed new federal capital Brazilia, in Central Brazil, was the largest urbanism continuous project ever, designed by Brazilian Oscar Niemeyer in an attempt to create a new society. The Syrian capital Damascus in the world's oldest continuously inhabited city, still centered on the Roman Age commercial axis. It retains various monuments in consecutive styles, such as Christian churches, Musim mosques, an Ottoman 'chan' (caravan 'serail', i.e. resting station) on the Silk route, adapting to political history able to cohabit with many different ethno-linguistic and religious communities, joined by shared cultural traditions such as story telling. The modernist high-rise US metropolis New York City is the Western world's largest, richest melting pot. Dan focuses on his favorite skyscraper there, the huge, integrated multi functional (mainly offices) Rockefeller Center, ten buildings on 24 acres started in 1931. Dharavi, in the Indian commercial and industrial metropolis Mumbai (Bombay), is Asia's largest slum (600,000 inhabitants), testifies to the spontaneously improvised 'architectural' building of a dynamic socio-economic network among the poor ex-rural immigrants since the 1930s from Indian regional and cultural origins, practically neglected by the authorities. Dan Cruickshank visits and explains the relevance of death to several architectural masterpieces: a chapel decorated with human bones in Sedlec, Chzechia; the Mayan temples like Yaxha (now in Guatemala), where the sacrifice of blood, carrier of life force, was central the religion devoted to the natural cycle of life; Staglieno cemetery in Genoa, Europe's largest cemetery; and the complex, central position of tombs in the Ancient culture of Pharaonic Egypt. Dan explores architectural heritage gravely affected by the ravages of war and natural disasters. In Dresden, the 'Florence at the Elbe', a uniquely consistent Baroque city, the 1945 allied air raid laid waste to 75% in order to undermine the German war spirit, in part restored after the German reunification, including the masterpiece Frauenkirche (Our Lady church). Palmyra, a silk route city in the Syrian desert, was destroyed and abandoned after emperor Aurelian's legions repressed a foolish declaration of independence by queen Zenobia, who even invaded neighboring Roman provinces. San Francisco was virtually wiped away by the 1906 massive earthquake, yet people hardly worry that the next one will probably happen in the next decades, only some (re)building uses more resistant techniques. It's quite an adventure in civil war-ravaged Afganistan (2008) to visit the lonely Jam minaret (1109, near Herat in the West), last monumental remnant of the once mighty Ghurid empire. Dan visits places where architecture embodies or evokes dreams or nightmares. The walled city, Shibam, in Yemen, the relatively fertile south of the Arabian peninsula, has the world's oldest high-rise, each tower build and constantly maintained for one family in Ancient-traditional mud bricks. In the Dominican Republic, half of the Caribbean island of Hispaniola, lies the first Conquistador city. It was founded to embody the dream of a new Spanish empire and is now the capital Santo Domingo, which preserves the vast oldest American cathedral, in Plateresque (inspired by Spanish silver plates) style with a Gothic interior, from which spreads the renaissance-revival of the Ancient rational rectangular blocks grid adopted throughout the continent. The viceregal palace Alcazar de Colon embodies the contrast between great wealth and enslaving of Indians, as they died -mainly from epidemics- replaced by African slaves import, resulting in the Antillean ethno-cultural melting pot. Philadelphia on the US East Coast was the site of the 1776 Declaration of Independence, yet its most impressive building is the Eastern State Penitentiary, opened in 1829 to rid Pennsylvanian society of crime by Quaker reeducation of convicts instead of the traditional abusive regime. This building, now a picturesque ruin, a grim reminder of solitary confinement where manual labor was carried out in virtual darkness, and according to Dickens, worse then beatings. Its star-shaped layout was copied worldwide. In Thimpu, the small capital of the Budhist Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan, the Trashi Choe Song, 'fortress of glorious religion', seat of a monastery, monarchy and government, embodies the king's policy to maintain traditional values in architecture -preserved and new- dress code etc., combined with some innovations such as TV. Dan Cruickshank visits major works of architectural art which represent paradise on earth, including a hanging Taoist temple in the Chinese mountains where one feels in total harmony with nature, the self-sufficient, secluded orthodox Sinai monastery in the Sinai desert, the Ottoman Suleiman mosque which represents the gates to paradise and the concentric design of the Tamil Hindu holy city Sri Ranganthaswamy, where everything is fitted for the cult practices, both daily and during the great annual festival when the normally well-hidden holiest is shown even to the infidels in a grand procession. Historian and writer Dan Cruickshank celebrates architecture as a creative force as he explores the world's greatest cities, buildings and monuments. Dan explores how architecture gives us pleasure, visiting the luxurious Taj hotel in India, a fantasy castle in Germany, and the hedonist surrounds of an ancient Pompeii brothel. Finally, Dan explores the Villa Barbaro, one of the world's most beautiful country houses where pleasure was deemed to be created by perfect architecture. Dan visits architectural expressions of power. Ceausescu's Palace of the People was a megalomaniac testimony to the last European Communist dictatorship, for which half of the capital was destroyed so it could have an immense axis-view. After the party's downfall, it ironically houses parliament, the embodiment of a democratic alternative. The 'impregnable' crusader castle of Marqab is an impressive example of mainly military might, built and held by the military order knights. It was part of a series of fortifications designed to stem the Muslim tide of Saladdin's triumphant armies, who nevertheless overran the crusader state. Istanbul's Ottoman sultan's harem, the seraglio, is frequently seen in the West as the Oriental ultimate brothel, but was rather a matter of demonstrating the immensely wealthy sultan's prestige, housing not just his hundreds (or up to a few thousand) concubines (Islam allows only four wives, so they were recruited as infidel slaves from the provinces, then converted) but most importantly their sons, the pretenders to the throne of the Turkish empire, hence a battlefield of intrigue for power for the successor and his mother, who would become as sultan-valide a force to be reckoned with behind his throne. Evergreen estate New Orleans embodies the North American, notably Dixie, culture of slaveholders, a grand home in neo-Greek style (stands for the combination of democracy and slavery) and miserable wooden shacks for the chattel black 'bests of burden'. Marty and Gerard decide to go to carpentry school, taught by the German instructor Mr. Guudsaw. After they finish learning at school, the two best friends decide to each build their own homes. But one night, a great storm arrives and destroys Marty's flimsy home... Hosted by well-known disc-jockey Fred Robbins (and later Bill Williams), this show gave viewers a glimpse into the world of jazz. Showcasing the talents of some of the premier musicians and singers of the genre, Robbins also introduced viewers to some of the inside lingo used by the performers and their fans. Adam Troy was an American Korean War veteran who stayed in the Pacific after the war. As captain of the schooner "Tiki III", Troy drifted from adventure to adventure while carrying passengers and cargo anywhere from Hong Kong to Pitcairn Island. His original partner was Chinese-American Oliver Lee, and he was assisted by first mates Clay Baker and later Chris Parker. Adam Troy is contracted to search for a large diamond somewhere in the South Pacific. All he has to go on is a story he overheard in a bar some years ago of a bright red plane which came down in a lagoon on a remote island at the beginning of World War II. A seaplane carrying eight elderly Chinese merchants from Vila to Siagon sends out a mayday message and goes missing. Sometime later, the grand-daughter of one of the men charters the services of Adam and Oliver to search for her grand-father when a rare ring he was carrying is found on an island in the opposite direction from Vila to where the plane should have been traveling.

The parent discussion group shares experiences they have had with their children. All parents agreed that almost every accident can be prevented with enough forethought. Real life situations illustrate the safety procedures parents should incorporate into their family's daily life Teenager Billy Williams and his sister Hannah live with their mother Nancy at a hunting and fishing lodge in Rainbow Country, the popular name of the North Channel area of Lake Huron in Ontario, Canada. The lodge was built by Billy's father Frank, who disappeared two years earlier when his bush plane went down while he was prospecting for gold. At 15, Billy is an accomplished wilderness guide, scuba diver, angler, spelunker, white-water canoeist, photographer, marksman, rock climber, skydiver and electric bass player in his rock group The Thunderbirds. Billy sports a mop of shaggy blond hair and always wears a gold mohair sweater, a GWG denim jacket, beige jeans and Kodiak boots, even on the most sweltering of summer days. Billy's best friend is Pete Gawa, a native Canadian who is equally adept at all the outdoor skills. The inseparable pair experience an endless string of adventures, thwarting the designs of jewel thieves (Mystery at Whaleback Bay), kidnappers (Pursuit Along the Aux Sables), Iron Curtain defectors (Stolen Tugboat), airplane hijackers (Milk Run), the military (Wall of Silence), petty larcenists (Roar of the Hornet), witch doctors (The Return of Eli Rocque) and the Devil himself (Lac du Diable). Dreamer's Rock, a quartzite peak just opposite the lodge is a sacred place where First Nations youth would experience a vision to determine their life's role. Mr Travers of the Serpent River Mining Company is staying at the lodge, ostensibly to relax. Meanwhile the Chief at Birch Island has expressed concerns that Pete is not spending enough time among his own people. The Chief tells Pete that the mining company is planning to make a quarry out of Dreamer's Rock. Pete, beginning to question his friendship with Billy, finds Travers and Billy at the top of Dreamer's Rock and insists that they leave. Travers reports to his boss Evert that Dreamer's Rock is rich in minerals and plans to set up a blast. Billy and Pete conclude that despite their cultural differences, they have a common purpose: to stop Travers and Evert from blowing up Dreamer's Rock. Hannah wins a school debating contest for which the prize is four tickets to the circus. Hannah invites her mother Nancy, brother Billy and friend Pete. As they sit down to dinner Hannah discovers that she had left the tickets back at the lodge. Billy and Hannah boat back to the lodge to retrieve them. Billy waits for Hannah at the dock and when she doesn't return after a long time, goes inside to investigate. He can't find her anywhere. Billy calls in the strange disappearance to Nancy back at the restaurant. Nancy and Pete borrow a motor launch and race back to the lodge to find out what happened to Hannah. Father Bob Coburn leads a group of canoeists who are retracing the original route of voyageur and explorer Etienne Brule. Billy and Pete get involved scouting portages and campsites. There is disagreement among the group as to whether Brule would have shot a ferocious set of rapids. Billy and Pete become concerned when Father Coburn considers shooting the rapids himself. Roger, Billy and Pete set out to disprove the rumours and superstitions regarding Lac du Diable (Devil's Lake). First they must find Big Joe Lavallee who is the only one who can guide them there. The three get bogged down in a swamp and Big Joe comes along in an ATV to bail them out. Big Joe can't understand why Roger wants to tangle with the devil, but agrees to take him and the boys to the lake the next day. Roger wonders why it is taking so long and Billy, having stolen a look at Big Joe's map before they set out, says they are going the wrong way. When confronted, Big Joe tells them to find the lake on their own. Billy remembers the directions and when the arrive at Devil's Lake, Roger dives below with his camera equipment. Something strange happens, and Big Joe hears a voice telling him to hurry to Lac du Diable to help his friends. While fishing at Lake on Blue Mountain, Billy and Pete discover several dead fish and a milky substance in the water. Dougall gives them a tow to Whitefish Falls, where they are unable to contact Dennis or the Lands and Forests rangers.

The floor nearly caves in during Kent and Olsen's visit. Later, a member's chemical company catches fire. None of these things are put down to bad luck: they are clearly the work of a saboteur. Suspicion falls on the meeting house's raving, superstitious landlord. It's up to Superman, however, to find the true culprit. A scientist develops an advanced computer he dubs "Mr. Kelso." A criminal gains the confidence of the scientist and access to Mr. Kelso. The result: a series of perfectly timed bank robberies.

Lois (Noel Neill) writes a story about the discovery of an ancient necklace with alleged magic powers. It is said that whosoever wears the necklace will be protected from all harm.

So Clark turns into Superman and tries to get into the cube but even he can't get in. So he goes to a scientist for help. Barton's brother who's been keeping an eye on things for Barton, is worried that Superman might find a way so he grabs Lois and Jimmy. The scientist postulates that Superman might be able to alter his molecules that he can pass through anything solid but he is warned that since the material the cube is made of not known, he might not get out. When Superman tries to get through he learns of Lois and Jimmy, so he gets out before going all the way. And when Barton's brother tells Superman to stay away till the 7 year mark is reached, he decides to try another ploy to get Barton.

Of course, Superman's alter ego Clark Kent knows that the daggers are phony. Why, then, is someone willing to steal every one of the daggers that have been sold in Metropolis? Well, it seems that a con man named Jasper (Arthur Space) is hoping to dupe Superman into using his X-Ray vision to transform two of the worthless daggers into valuable radium!

However,if a gang of crooks, against whom Lois can testify, have their way, the wedding will never take place. Sterling Holloway returns as eccentric scientist Uncle Oscar, who while trying to cook up a formula for flavored stamp glue ends up with a powerful explosive. Rather than write down the entire formula, Uncle Oscar teaches vital segments of the formula to his talking parakeet Schuyler. A pair of foreign spies steal Schuyler and substitute a lookalike, then kidnap Oscar and his niece Nancy (Allene Roberts) in order to steal the explosive. This looks like a job for Superman (George Reeves)--but it may also prove to be his undoing, inasmuch as the loquacious Schuyler is savvy to Superman's "Clark Kent" guise. The notorious gangster, Turk Jackson, has decided to turn himself in - not directly to the police, but to Clark Kent, a fine, upstanding citizen who might act as a buffer between the crude gunman and the cops.

Crooked sideshow man Carni (Ben Welden) decides to steal the invention so that he can rob a few banks. Thus it is that Clark Kent disappears, and Superman appears in his place, the better to revert back to "downside-up" (or something like that).

All that changes when the colony meets a boy with a Gummi Bear medallion which unlocks the Great Book of Gummi which reveals lost knowledge of their past.

Obnoxious Lord Willoughby makes a risk-everything bet with Sir Gawain that he won't be able to find a Gummi Bear. Cavin can't break his promise and show him Gummi Glen to help so begs the Gummi Bears to step in and help him themselves. But there's an added reason for urgency: Tummi has eaten fruit off a tree that causes anyone to do so to turn into a tree himself and a spell is needed to save him. But the Gummi medallion has fallen off of Zummi's neck while getting him inside and Willoughby has found it, and is set on hiding it so Gawain can't be proved right. The Gummies ask Gawain to team up with them to reclaim it.

Duke Igthorn has gone searching for Bigtooth, a legendary termite with an immense ability to destroy. But all that Cavin, Sunni, and Cubbi know when the Monarch's Day float they are helping set up blows by Drekmore is that the place is, uncharacteristically, deserted. A year later, there has not even been a sign of Igthorn, and most of the Gummis reason that the most dangerous human is gone so they can call the Great Gummis home again, and send a letter to Ursalia with Artie so the signal can be sent. Then Igthorn shows up and plants Bigtooth in the Gummis' wooden home... Zummi has escaped but is alone, with Grammi and Tummi still forced to run the gummiberry-juice-producing factory, Gruffi and Gusto imprisoned in Dunwyn Castle under Igthorn's control, and Sunni and Cubbi unaware of the others' fates and searching for them with Cavin.

Duke Igthorn remembers a story about the Gummiscope, a signal machine whose solar power could also be the perfect weapon for him to conquer Dunwyn. Cavin catches him sneaking off with a page on it from a book on Gummi Bears, and tells the Gummis who learn it's the signal machine their ancestors were left with to contact the other Gummis who fled abroad, when humans are no longer a threat. They locate it and contact one group of Gummis but Tummi's knocking the ray off-course results in Igthorn's spotting it, and they're forced to retreat from his attack.

A book on tradition gives her some ideas, but she goes to even further extremes until the others are ready to turn the tables on her. In "Loopy, Go Home," Cubbi finds a wolf cub and raises it, despite Gruffi's objections. In "A-Hunting We Will Go," a wild boar menaces Dunwyn Forest, and though King Gregor and Sir Tuxford boast of their hunting prowess to Cavin, it's Sunni, Grammi, and Calla who have to save them. Sunni visits Calla to cheer herself up while being stuck cleaning with Tummi and Cubbi, but hides in a box transferred with Calla and King Gregor to King Jean-Claude's country, forcing Cubbi and Tummit o follow. Calla is not happy to see Marie again, and her mood doesn't improve when Sunni's refusal to hide as bidden results in her humiliation when she is forced to claim clumsiness so no one knows Sunni caused disturbances around her.

An elf named Carney running a sideshow doesn't have any success acting as a Gummi Bear, but his disguise fools Grammi, who sees him in a fight and "rescues" him, taking him to Gummi Glen. He is disappointed to learn that they are not creatures of wealth as some stories claim, but decides using them in his show will increase his profit. He lures them all into a trap which they can't seem to escape from, but they are determined...

To infiltrate the troops and learn what Igthorn is planning, Cavin has Zummi turn him into an ogre, but only has one night to discover what's going on and warn the others about it, or the transformation will be for good. Cubbi tries to watch his progress but is captured and, since Cavin can't stop his imprisonment without giving himself away, suspects that Cavin has transformed mentally as well as physically.

His ogres pour it in Dunwyn Castle's moat so everyone except Calla, hiding from the pointlessness of princess life in a basement room, and Cavin, visiting Gummi Glen, are affected.

Zummi uncovers a magical quilt that contains pictures of every noble deed a Gummi ever performed. Sunni borrows it to show Calla, but Lady Bane runs into her and steals it, trying to harness its energy for her own power.

Cubbi sneaks along and in Ursalia they find a lone, eccentric elderly Gummi knight, Sir Thornberry. To get to a Great Book, they have to drive back the Troggles, a group of creatures that serve a witch named Lady Bane who has a Gummi medallion and wants to gain a Great Book to have its power for herself. Lady Bane's youth potion taken a century before has worn off and signs that she is a millennium old begin to show before she has company, so she sends her Troggles to find something young enough to exchange her age for that being's youth. They run across Sunni and don't succeed in capturing her but do get a tuft of hair. The next day the others think she's grown to the point where they can finally tell, and she is delighted to be taken as something more than a child by the others, especially Gusto. But the next day she is elderly, and Zummi, Gruffi, and Gusto set out to undo Lady Bane's spell, but she is determined to follow despite her now being so weak...

Eventually calling himself the Crimson Avenger, he assists those in need - and thwarts a highwayman named Erwillian, who's inspired to try stealing in Dunwyn itself. He steals rubies from King Gregor and plants one on Cavin to have him accused as the thief. Cubbi, who has Tummi be his sidekick "Bronto" to keep his secret, loses popularity with the people when he mistakes one of Erwilian's thugs' victims as the man's attacker and has a bounty is placed on his head, and resolves to quit when Tummi is hurt while helping him also. But when Calla tries to prove Cavin's innocence by disguising herself as The Crimson Avenger, and is caught by Erwillian and kept under guard, Cubbi is forced to think of a way to prove both his friends' innocence. Just as the gears in Gummi Glen's system fail and there's no way to escape the roasting heat, a prince from the Great East, where they are well-known and revered, comes seeking them to help with a special task. Duke Igthorn orders Toadwart to steal Prince Yen Moon's statuette he was going to use as part of it, but can't figure out how to use it to get power like he wanted.

When Duke Igthorn hears a story of an armor that makes its wearer invincible, he knows where it would be located and steals it, but to his disappointment it only hits Toadwart. Still, he's delighted when Toadwart defeats King Gregor's knights...until Toadwart decides not to drop his newfound power in favor of Igthorn after all. With the other Gummis away, Zummi, Sunni, and Cubbi are approached by an escaped Calla to form a plan to bring down Toadwart and free Dunwyn from his rule. Cubbi becomes obsessed with flying after hearing a story of the mythical Aerials. He builds a gummiberry-juice-powered jet pack and has Artie instruct him, and finds their floating island. But the Aerials aren't winged like legends say but use machines...and they have another secret: they're old enemies subdued by the Ancient Gummies and plan to capture the Gummies and enslave them to power their aircraft like Cubbi did his "wings".

Sir Victor is called in as a temporary replacement and beats back Duke Igthorn attempting to sneak into Dunwyn Castle. But Igthorn is inspired by Toadwart to disguise himself and replace his brother to conquer Dunwyn from within, so Toadwart traps Sir Victor by pretending to need help while he is out seeing what he can do for Dunwyn.

However, Cubbi learns of a dark side to the warrior when Gritty, still harboring a grudge against humans, tries to drive away the flock of a shepherd boy named Rafi who believes in Gummi Bears, resulting in his leaders' entering the desert to seek the wild animal they think is responsible. Duke Igthorn buys a gypsy love potion to make Lady Bane fall for him. She, meanwhile, has had her Troggles out Gummi Bear-hunting and has succeeded in capturing Tummi. As their two carriage race toward each other and crash, the bottle of potion breaks and sends it spraying over the other carriage. Lady Bane has fallen in love with Toadwart, to Igthorn's misery, and is aware that Tummi has fallen in love with her so tries to exploit this to get him to give her the Great Book of Gummi so she can be all-powerful...

It may be the only thing able to help him to fight off Duke Igthorn when he and his ogres return and capture Cubbi.

Shortly before the launch he meets McBain, who tells him about the phony accident ten years previously. Chris doesn't believe him, but Laura, an attractive journalist, investigates the matter and actually finds some evidence to support McBain's allegations.

They are not ready to let their profitable business go easily... The rain forest in and around equatorial Africa's Congo basin is the continent's richest and most varied environment. The abundance of food however also means extremely competition for it, while plants race to the light, using surprisingly dirty trick to 'cheat' for a spot in one of many stories from the ground to the tower-high canopy. Deserts, like southern Africa's Kalahari and Namib, are strange and by definition are particularly dangerous and demanding environments, requiring elaborate adaptations. Some are behavioral, like tricks to steal food or even lay eggs in live hosts. other are anatomical. All the more precious is the rare water, so drinking pools are crucial for carnivores and preys. Astonishingly, vast quantities are trapped in huge cave systems underground, where aquatic life is scarce due to little food and light dripping in. Over a few thousand years, climate change drove many species from an abundant part of (Northern) Africa to the coastal and mountain edges, where some population persist, as most turned into the Sahara. It's actually mostly stone, yet the fifth sand causes almost instant apocalyptic dangers: sand storms which swallow whole caravans or even villages in no time. Specialist species adapt admirably to drought, spots where the vast water reserve emerges are bountiful oases. Volcanoes, some still active, shape East Africa's vast savannas, mainly consisting of grasslands where huge wildebeest and other herds roam and their annual migration steers the habitat type's complex life cycle. Some areas still remain primeval jungle, or became marshes or even hostile salt zones, yet all harbor intensive wildlife,whose lives are a merciless struggle for life, for elephants as well as insectivores. 'David Attenborough' (qv) takes a look at the future of the world's warmest and wildest continent, which like our planet saw more change in the last half century then ever before, and must expect even more. Problems like demography and climate change are immense, enlarging others like poaching and habitat loss. Nevertheless he sees positive things too, like growing conservation awareness and efforts, including from native tribes, even ferocious hunters like the Masai. Africa is a land sculpted by time where animals have evolved complex weapons to arm them in the battle to live another day. An elephant's tusks can defend, or attack. An octopus uses camouflage to find food, or hide from an enemy. A Cape Fur Seal's speed and agility are valuable tools to catch a penguin, but ineffectual against a Great White Shark. A single hippopotamus holds a pride of twelve lions at bay with his sheer bulk, but backs down when faced with the piercing teeth of another hippo. With lethal weapons wielded by fearsome predators and prey, animals walk a precarious path, here among Africa's Deadliest. With its uniquely African identity, flavor, and feel, the series takes viewers behind the headlines into the heart of conflict. Whether it is a village kgotla (council of elders) mediating a land dispute in the former Zaire, or the Truth and Reconiciliation Commision in South Africa, each episode demonstrates that good storytelling does not have to glorify conflict for its own sake-that an agreement can be as dramatic as any soap opera. At the same time, the series challenges the view that Africa is incapable of solving its own problems. Series exploring how the vibrant contemporary African art scene is emerging as a global force.

The show is a mockumentary behind-the-scenes look at the _"Chelsea Lately" (2007)_ (qv) show. The show's host and creative leader 'Chelsea Handler' (qv) likes to think of her staff, especially the writing staff, as family, albeit a highly dysfunctional family where she is the only bright one amid a bunch of morons. Her writing staff is comprised of stand-up comedians who double as on-air personalities. The two special cases among her staff are her assistant, 'Chuy Bravo' (qv), her "Little Nugget" who basically does nothing around the set but look cute, and the show's chef, her one true family member on set, her brother 'Roy Handler' (qv) who she treats equally as bad as her writing staff. Most of the characters, portrayed by their real life selves, are highly exaggerated versions of their real life. Chelsea thinks that her assistant Eva's characterization of a girl with a lisp is hilarious, and wants the writing staff to write a sketch for Eva using this character. The problem is is that none of the writers think the character and her situation is funny. They just hope that if they ignore Chelsea's request, Chelsea will just forget about it. But Chelsea doesn't forget. Visiting on-set, Chelsea's friend, 'Jennifer Aniston' (qv), also thinks the characterization is not funny, tells the writers as much, and encourages them to tell Chelsea to her face, which they feel could jeopardize their jobs. Meanwhile, an upcoming guest has canceled at short notice. As the staff brainstorms for a replacement, Jiffy mentions that he thinks he can probably get 'Jane Fonda' (qv) to appear since he used to work for her, which none of the other staff knew. Is Jiffy as good a friend to Jane as he says he is, and even if so, will Jane, who has never heard of Chelsea let alone her show, mesh with Chelsea's sensibilities of comedy? And Josh reluctantly makes a $5,000 bet on the outcome of a football game with 'Jay Leno' (qv) at a house party at Ross' place. Josh regrets making the bet after the end of the game even more, but not because he lost. After appearing as a guest on the show, 'Reese Witherspoon' (qv) begins to hang around the Lately offices. At first, all the writers clamor to have her be their individual new BFF, which Reese seems more than willing to be to each of them. But over time, a little Reese goes a long way. The writers have to figure out a tactful way to tell Chelsea of Reese's intrusions into their working life as Chelsea, who has not been subject to Reese's intrusions, is oblivious to the situation and as such still considers Reese a close friend. Meanwhile, Lionel, one of the security guards, buys Heather's lunch for her at the food truck. This incident leads to some awkward encounters between the two as Heather tries to reciprocate, while Lionel begins to question what Heather's actions mean. And Chuy asks Brad, the Jewish MBA, for advice on how to negotiate his still active contract with Chelsea. The writing staff is excited by the news that Ross will once again be hosting the show tomorrow because of Chelsea's scheduled absence... a little too excited for Chelsea's liking. Chelsea does whatever she can to make her staff like her as much as they seem to like Ross, even stooping to such abhorrent behavior for Chelsea as being nice to them. It may be difficult for Chelsea not to show her jealousy, which may affect both her staff and Ross. Meanwhile, Brad and Jiffy, in viewing the daily rushes of a just filmed skit, notice that Chelsea's dog 'Jackie (XXX)' (qv) seems to be going down on Heather, and Heather, in return, is encouraging Jax to do so. Heather tries to clear her good Catholic name from what she sees as smut pedaling by her colleagues. And Chuy, spouting poetry, seems to be on a self-empowerment movement. He admits that he is because of his friend Melissa. This story takes on a slightly different dimension when everyone learns about which Melissa he is referring. Chelsea takes great pride in celebrating the birthday of every one of her staff with great fanfare and festivity. So Chelsea is angry when on the next birthday in which she places Sarah in charge of getting the birthday cake, Sarah ends up getting a poor substitute for a cake: cruditï¿½s. While berating Sarah publicly at every opportunity for this gaffe, Chelsea does whatever she can to make it up to the birthday boy, Micah, especially as this birthday was his first as a staffer. However, Chelsea's efforts may be more geared toward her want to celebrate a birthday her way than what Micah may want. Meanwhile, Chelsea learns that Brad has been invited to Ross and Salvador's house for Sunday brunch, Brad believing that it is a business lunch of some sort. Chelsea decides to pull one of her email pranks by sending Ross an email from Brad's email account stating that he wants advice on his own coming out. And Chuy asks Heather to emcee his foundation's fund-raiser. Chelsea tries to get out of going if only to avoid watching Heather's shameless self-promotion. Chelsea has brought in a Denver based super fan, a wheelchair-ridden physically disabled eighteen year old named Jordan, to be guest assistant in Chuy's place for a show. After Brad learns that some of the show's interns took Jordan out for a sedate night on the town the previous night, Brad convinces Chris and Josh to join him in taking Jordan out this evening, each of the three staffers who has his own motivation for wanting to be part of the outing. They may all regret it when each assumes that one of the other two saw Jordan back to his hotel at the end of the night, while none of the three did. They now have to find out what happened to Jordan. Meanwhile, Chelsea has a medical issue which is making her pass excessive and quite smelly gas. She has to provide a stool sample for analysis to determine her medical issue. Despite being reluctant to "poop in a box", Chelsea does, and asks Jiffy to take it to the medical lab for her. Rather than be grossed out by his cargo, Jiffy feels privileged to do this task for Chelsea, but a comment by Brad may change his feeling about it. And Heather is angry that promotional items sent through the talent department for the talent has been staying with the talent department. While Brad and Jiffy are working late one evening at the office, they are interrupted by the Latina cleaning lady who is doing her regular rounds. Brad in particular is annoyed by what he considers her intrusive manner, not only in the loud vacuuming, but also her loud voice while she speaks Spanish on her cell phone. As such, Brad has her fired the next day. What Brad is unaware of is that the cleaning lady, Guadalupe, is Chelsea's favorite. Brad also learns that Chelsea is planning on giving Guadalupe a gift when she starts her shift that evening because of a personal issue through which Guadalupe is going. Brad knows that he has to get Guadalupe rehired or his career working for Chelsea is on the line. Brad finds that rehiring Guadalupe isn't as easy as it was to get her fired. Meanwhile, Heather is rehearsing being a talk show host for that day whenever Chelsea will ask her to guest host the show or when she gets her own talk show. Sarah is Heather's pretend guest. Sarah treats the situation like the make-believe that it is, while Heather treats it like a real talk show, which causes some bad feelings in the office. And Chelsea's warm up comedian calls in sick. After going through the list of staff members to do the job for tonight's show, she ultimately chooses non-comedian Roy. Will Roy be able to discover his comedian mojo? Heather and especially Sarah are perturbed that someone has been continually doing the number two in the women's restroom but not flushing. Sarah, who does almost anything required to find out the culprit (while Heather seemingly will do anything), figures that it is someone with anger issues, so she goes on a search for the angriest woman in the office. While Steve does his own somewhat creepy surveillance, Sarah thinks that Brad may know something more about it than he is letting on. Meanwhile, Chelsea has instituted the "Nope" board at the office, on which she hangs what she considers offending pieces of clothing that her staff wears. Among the items confiscated and posted on the board are Steve's running shoes (which results in him exposing his infected toes) and Johnny's selection of shirts, one of which he was planning on wearing to a small intimate party to which he has been invited by Chelsea to 'Jennifer Aniston' (qv)'s house. Heather hates the Nope board if only because Chelsea buys the person nice clothing in replacement, so Heather figures that fashion conscious people like her are left out in the cold. And Brad and Chris convince a nervously excited Johnny that he may have a chance of getting intimate with Jennifer at the party. Jiffy's fellow writers believe that Hank, the studio's aging maintenance man, has a gay crush on Jiffy, based on Hank doing little favors for him, admiring a photograph of him in a woman's brassiere, and giving Jiffy an extra ticket to a Clippers game to attend with him. Jiffy's colleagues want him to use his influence on Hank to get work done for them. But Jiffy may be able to take his and Hank's supposed gay romance so far. Hank may have some say in the matter as well. Meanwhile, Sarah doesn't like that Chris has jumped on the bandwagon to give himself a fake assistant, which Heather and Brad have. Heather and Brad treat their fake assistants like they're real, especially as those fake assistants have been getting them perks. But when Sarah wants one of those perks, she has to decide if she will go the fake assistant route to get it. Chelsea enacts a specific punishment for Brad for being late to meetings. And Heather uses a black doll in a baby's car seat to be able to drive to work in the carpool lane. The doll in the car has an unintended consequence. Chris receives a message from a beautiful nineteen year old woman named Kaylee, who wants to have dinner with him. Chris, who is more than twice her age, is excited about what he considers a sure thing regarding another notch on his bedpost. But Kaylee has another reason for wanting to meet Chris: she believes he is her biological father. Kaylee's mother was not very sexually active during the time she would have been conceived, meaning that the possible list of men who could be her father is small. To make things worse for Chris, Kaylee tells him that she's a new mom, meaning that Chris has possibly gone from being in his own mind a young vibrant stud to a grandfather, which his fellow Lately colleagues won't let him forget. Meanwhile, at an autograph signing, Brad calls a young woman with autism a drunk before he finds out that she is autistic. He immediately apologizes to her. However, him berating the girl is caught on video, which goes viral over the Internet. The apology is not included in the video, which places Brad in a bad public light. And Chelsea's infatuation with Sergeant Pickles, the pug dog of Jen's comic friend Janie, may cause a permanent rift between Jen and Janie. After a wild office party, a hungover Heather has no idea what happened at it or how she ended up on a couch outside the Lately offices the morning after. But what's worse is that she has no idea how she got a hickey. Peter wasn't at the party, which means to her Catholic sensibilities that she cheated on him, most-likely with one of the lowlife crew members. Sarah and Jiffy try to help her figure out which of the crew members she cheated with. One of the staff members knows more than he/she lets on. Meanwhile, Josh intercepts a parcel addressed to Sarah. With Chelsea, Brad and Steve present and in agreement, Josh proceeds to open the parcel. But when Chelsea sees what's inside, she changes her mind. Josh, Brad and Steve try to figure out what is inside the box and why Chelsea is so protective of Sarah and the parcel's contents. And Jen has been tweeting to recent guest 'David Grohl' (qv) - she being perhaps his second biggest fan (after Sarah) - all in an effort to get backstage passes for the 'Foo Fighters' (qv)' concert. The tweets have the exact opposite effect as Dave believes she's a stalker. He provides backstage passes for all the staff except Jen. Will Jen's colleagues back her against Dave and the band? After show guest 'Kate Beckinsale' (qv) insults Chelsea for her lack of physical fitness, Chelsea decides to dictate part of Kate's health regimen to her writing staff: a five day juice cleanse, where they are to consume nothing but. The questions become not only if they can survive purely on juice for five days, but whether they can stand being around each other surviving solely on juice for five days. Meanwhile, Heather receives a largely inaudible voice message from Chelsea, who is berating the intended recipient of that message. Heather does whatever she can to figure out if Chelsea is indeed angry at her, or if Chelsea pocket dialed and that the screaming was directed at someone else. The one thing Heather is not willing to do is ask Chelsea directly as it's "that time of the month". And someone has damaged Fortune's car in the parking lot in an apparent hit and run. Although it takes some doing, they find out that it was 'Kevin Nealon' (qv), which surprises everyone since Kevin is known as one of the nicest people in Hollywood. After all is said and done, Fortune may regret finding out it was Kevin. Chelsea is in a bad mood since she is horny, but refuses to masturbate to relieve her sexual frustration since she doesn't believe in masturbation. Since Chelsea's relationships with celebrities have all ended disastrously, the writers convince her that she should have a sexual dalliance with one of the crew members to relieve her sexual frustration. The person they collectively choose is Andy, one of the assistant directors. Chelsea refuses to approach Andy herself, so her staff have to arrange for Andy to come to a party at Chelsea's house. The process of getting Andy to the party ends up being more satisfying than the planned end result, but that satisfaction is for people other than Chelsea. Meanwhile, Brad has forgotten his ID at home and Robbie, the security guard on duty, won't allow Brad onto the lot without that ID. Rather than go home to get his ID, Brad does whatever he can to get onto the lot, which leads to Brad's day of misadventures. And the writers all line up for the free massages at the studio they believe the studio brass and/or Chelsea have arranged, especially as those that have already received massages believe this masseuse gives the best massages ever. The writers end up learning more about the masseuse by the end of the day. Chelsea asks Jiffy to work on a project ghost writing a book for her new dog, 'Jackie (XXX)' (qv). This project entails Jiffy spending more time with Jackie and by association Chelsea at her house. As Jiffy's initial visit while working on this project progresses, Ben, also visiting Chelsea at the time, comes to the conclusion, based on what he sees, that Chelsea wants to have sex with Jiffy, despite she knowing that Jiffy is married. Jiffy has to decide if he will give into Chelsea's seeming advances, and if he doesn't whether that will affect his personal and professional relationship with her. Meanwhile, Sarah and Brad notice that Karen, one of the staff accountants who neither really knows, has a disabled parking pass and thus has a prime parking location, but she doesn't seem to be disabled. They take it upon themselves to see if Karen is scamming the system and how they can either expose her or take advantage of her good thing. Chris being old and single makes the other staffers talk about what would happen if he figuratively fell down and couldn't get up. Chris later mentions that he has an ICE (in case of emergency) contact on his cell phone, that ICE who would be contacted by any first responder upon finding a debilitated Chris. This news brings up the fact that Jen had long replaced Sarah with Heather as her ICE without Jen ever having mentioned this fact to Sarah. This news could forever change the nature of Jen and Sarah's friendship. Meanwhile, the staffers treat Mike the announcer like the adopted sibling of the Lately family - someone who they tolerate to his face, but would rather not have around. They end up doing whatever they can not to hang around with Mike in social settings, until... And Chelsea has agreed to go with Heather to her book launch party. That party may end up being one of Chelsea's worst nightmares because of the complete guest list. Because Chelsea inadvertently leaves it lying around, Jiffy finds the latest report on the focus group testing of the regular round table panelist/writers, he who shares it with his affected colleagues. The news is not good. They all believe Chelsea will use this information to fire them. So they all do whatever it takes to change that public perception as outlined in the report. They also feel they have to kowtow to Chelsea even more so than usual, including mentoring in the network's intern program, and attending a fundraising event hosted by Chelsea. It's not so much that they have a problem attending such an event, which they all agreed to before finding out about the report, but that the event is $2,500 per plate, which they didn't know about until they agreed and which some can ill afford. It also does not help what they find out about the fundraiser later. Meanwhile, Brad has some art hanging in his office expressing his pride at being a redhead, which ends up offending Loni, with who he is already on bad terms. And Chelsea has another falling out with friend, 'Reese Witherspoon' (qv), this time over money. Chelsea has asked her friend 'Reese Witherspoon' (qv) to make the presentation to her of a Women in TV award. As such, Reese will be in the Lately offices for two days to work with the writing staff on the speech, which may not sit well with the writers, who clashed with Reese because of her overbearing personality the last time she was on set. Reese is well aware of the conflict, which she tries to smooth over for the two days. In doing so, Reese makes another enemy, namely Chelsea, who doesn't know if she can stand two days of Reese let alone having her make the speech at the awards ceremony. Meanwhile, Sarah is lamenting the fact that Brad and Heather have prime parking spots next to the office doors, while she is relegated to a parking spot in the dank basement garage. Jen manages to get Gary to give Sarah Brad's spot by telling him that she's pregnant. Although Sarah was unaware that Jen was going to do this, she has to decide if the parking spot is worth perpetuating the lie and withstanding Brad's ultimate ire. And Roy is irked by the fact that the staff are all raving about Chuy's salsa, which Chuy makes for them every day. They imply that Roy's good food is made spectacular by the addition of Chuy's salsa. Roy gets what he believes is his retribution when he learns how and where Chuy makes the salsa. Chelsea has arranged for a writers' weekend retreat to Cabo San Lucas, about which all the writers are excited. The one exception is Heather, who has an important conflicting engagement, and Chelsea refuses to change the date of the retreat. Heather decides to ditch her previous engagement to go to Cabo. Chelsea ultimately downgrades the weekend to another locale, so Heather tries to make the best of the slightly worse situation. But subsequent further downgrades by Chelsea leads to Heather making more changes of her own. Heather may wonder if the weekend is ultimately worth ditching her original engagement. Meanwhile, a discussion amongst the writing staff on the dangerous feeling in the dark parking garage brings out an unexpected expert in personal safety: T.J. While Jen initially balks at T.J.'s assertions that she needs to be more vigilant in her own personal protection, Sarah is mildly turned on by this new vision of T.J. So Sarah is quietly excited when she receives what she believes is a date request by T.J. to which she agrees. Sarah may always wonder if their encounter was truly a date. And Chuy asks Chris to help him get fit. Chris and Jiffy have more fun watching Chuy trying to work out than helping him. But Chuy may appreciate those watching eyes when an incident occurs in the gym. Chelsea pulls another of her email pranks, using Jiffy's account to send an email to 'Sharon Osbourne' (qv), an upcoming guest, and Lately executives, insulting Sharon. Chelsea feigns ignorance about the email. Jiffy knows Chelsea did it, and Sue and Gary know Chelsea did it, but as Chelsea is the star, Jiffy has the take the blame, which he doesn't appreciate. It gets worse for Jiffy when Sharon wants to speak to him about the incident after her appearance on the show, she who is known to have a temper. Meanwhile, Sarah catches a glimpse of Brad naked, of which Brad is unaware. She is more than surprised that she found his penis to be quite beautiful, and she thinks that Chelsea would be impressed by it too. Chelsea has no interest in seeing it for real, but she wouldn't mind seeing a photograph of it so that she can rip it up afterward. So Sarah goes on a mission clandestinely to take a photograph of Brad's penis. Brad ultimately has some say in the matter. And George, one of the show's researchers, is celebrating his first birthday as a Lately staffer. One of the birthday rituals at the office is the birthday board, where each staffer writes one word to describe how he/she truly feels about the birthday person. Just before the board is being presented to George, the staffers notice one word on it that may be seen as offensive and racist against George. Will anyone admit to writing that word? And what will George think about someone writing such a word? Eva, Chelsea's assistant, has taken it upon herself to organize the staff gift for Chelsea's birthday. Since Chelsea's mother passed away three years ago, Eva wanted to put together a book of photographs of the staffers with their own mothers, the belief that it will be a sentimental reminder of her loving relationship with her own mother. Although none of the staffers talk to Eva about it, half like the idea, while the other half believe it is a terrible idea since it will make Chelsea sad about her mother's passing. Even Roy believes Chelsea will either really like it or really hate it. Only giving it to Chelsea will they find out. Meanwhile, Chuy talks Heather, Brad and Jiffy into attending a golf course grand opening with him. It doesn't end up quite being what they thought, which is made all the more difficult in that the golf course advertised that Chelsea was going to be the star attraction. And Roy is preparing for a Playgirl photo shoot. Roy ends up not exposing as much as he thought he would, while those at the shoot wished that Roy didn't expose as much as he did. Based on what he sees as Chris' unusual behavior of late, Jiffy believes that Chris has becomes a drug addict. Although initially unbelieving of this assertion, Heather too comes to believe the same. Sarah, who believes she knows Chris the best among the staff, doesn't think there is any way Chris could be a drug addict. Regardless, they bring in some high powered help to stage an intervention for Chris. Based on what happens at the intervention, they perhaps should have staged the intervention for another staff member. Meanwhile, Roy is feeling unappreciated by the Lately staff, including by Chelsea. He states he has received a job offer to be 'Tori Spelling' (qv)'s personal chef, which Chelsea believes is only Tori's way of getting back at her for slagging her so often on the show. Roy, who is considering taking the job, will soon find out what Tori's motivations are for offering him the job. And on the advice of his agent, Chuy decides to participate in an actors' workshop to expand his horizons. Those that attend the workshop's stage presentation are surprised by Chuy's performance in more ways than one. Chelsea telling Sarah not to forget her passport is the first indication that many of the staff get that Chelsea is organizing one of her infamous trips, this time back to Cabo San Lucas. She rents a private jet that can only hold herself and ten other passengers, those other ten chosen however Chelsea decides at any given moment. With one spot gone, Brad, Heather and Jiffy in particular do whatever they can to get on Chelsea's Cabo list. But as more and more spots get taken, the three of them get more and more desperate. Meanwhile, Stella, the infant daughter of Kit, one of the staffers, is in the office for the day since Kit had no other child care option. Chelsea and the writers try to tread lightly around Stella, not wanting to be a bad influence, but Stella may already have a mind of her own, even at her tender age. And Jiffy believes that being the office whipping boy is a sign of respect. The writing staff is having problems with the show's young male production assistant, who won't do anything they ask him to do, while he does whatever he wants. Some of the staff believe that he's just misunderstood, until they deal with him directly, after which they all think he's an a**hole. They have to figure out a way to get rid of him while not tattling on him to either Gary or Chelsea. Meanwhile, 'James Van Der Beek' (qv) is today's guest on the show. He comes in sporting the same shirt that Chris is wearing, which may be a problem since Chris is scheduled to appear on the round table. Both James and Chris refuse to change their shirt, with James believing he has the right to wear it since he's the guest and is the celebrity between the two. He even uses intimidation and threats against Chris. Will Chris back down? Elsewhere, Josh's son, Jacob, believes that Chuy is much funnier than his dad, to which Josh is mildly offended as he believes Chuy is only funny because of his size and the fact that others write his lines for him. After discussing the issue with the other writers, Josh decides that it would be a good idea for Jacob to spend time with Chuy to see that he isn't funny in real life. Jacob does end up getting a different perspective on his dad and Chuy's comedy after spending time with Chuy. And Sarah gets the hots for any new person in her midst that has testosterone. At the office, Heather breaks down in tears because of a potentially marriage ending fight with her husband, Peter. Off the cuff, Chelsea tells Heather that she can stay with her for the weekend, or for as long as it takes for her and Peter to patch things up. Heather gladly accepts. Chelsea regrets asking Heather as Heather treats her stay like one big grown-up slumber party. Heather's actions also start to annoy Chelsea so much that she needs to invite Sarah over to act as a buffer. Chelsea does whatever she needs to to get Peter and Heather back together. Meanwhile, Chris and Brad are performing on a double bill, the marketing which irks Brad. Sarah has invited her most ardent fan, a seventeen year old Sacramento girl named Kelly, to a taping of the show. She begins to have mixed feelings about doing so. Regardless, Steve is the one who tries to benefit from Kelly's visit. And a faceless person is caught on the security camera peeing in the studio parking lot. If it's a staff person, he could get fired. Jiffy admits to Chris, Brad and Chuy that it was him. On advice from Chris, Jiffy confesses to security, which could mean the end of his job. Chelsea goes to extreme lengths to fight corporate so that Jiffy can keep his job. Chelsea accidentally tweets a photograph taken at a recent pool party of a faceless and exposed vagina. Good Catholic girl and mother Heather is mortified to see that it is her vagina, the photograph she didn't even know existed. Before the photograph is removed, it goes viral. But Heather's mortification turns to opportunity when she feels the publicity would be good for her book sales. But before she can pounce on this opportunity, the vagina is credited to 'Giuliana Rancic' (qv), who doesn't deny that it is her. Heather tries to take back ownership of her own vagina. Meanwhile, Chelsea prides herself on being loved by her entire staff. That's why she seems so upset that Xiao doesn't seem to like her. She's determined to find out if her perception is reality. And Chuy brings Catfish, his "little brother" - a black teen - into the office. Catfish's presence doesn't sit well with the other staffers who don't want to seem racist, but believe Catfish is responsible for the rash of recently gone missing items from the office. Ann is unable to return home for Christmas so Jimmy decides to have a family Christmas,which excludes Siobhan,to her annoyance. He and Diana argue over the decorations and over the school play - a modern dress version of 'Sleeping Beauty' though,when Diana takes over as its directrix she reverts it to a traditional setting and asks Jimmy to provide the scenery. When he refuses she threatens to spend Chriostmas in Italy,forcing him to come up with the scenery - which he just manages on time. He and Diana make up and wish each other a happy Christmas though Kev is put out that there is no office party. After Jimmy has an accident in the pub toilet and is seen returning two bags of alcohol illegally sold to Molly to the off-licence, Bobby and Kev assume that he has hit the bottle as a reaction to being dumped by Siobhan. They therefore abduct him and lock him in a bare room to go cold turkey before calling Diana to come and talk sense into him. Diana knows the truth but can Jimmy escape in time to prevent Molly going on a sleep-over to the Lake District? When Kev gets injured at work Bobby encourages him to sue Jimmy but Jimmy manages to catch him out and expose his condition as a sham. Meanwhile Diana takes voluntary redundancy at work,leading to a variety of jobs until she is reinstated as a supply teacher and Jimmy gets a new girl-friend,quantity surveyor Lisa and Alex gets an incredibly tall one,Chelsea. Jimmy decides it is time that he became a proper father and look after the children alone - to which end he sends Diana back to her house. However his incompetence spells inevitable disaster with the house being without electricity after he forgets to pay the bill and the kids being sent to school dirty. Alex and Molly decide to take action and threaten to move in with Diana unless their father lets her back home with them. He,of course,is only too glad to give in. Diana persuades Jimmy to join her local choral society,hoping to humiliate him but he is an unexpected hit and revels in the attention,and is asked to perform a duet with Diana. When she feels unable to carry it off he resigns from the society,telling her that he was thrown out but she discovers the truth. Molly is appalled when Alex arranges a double date with a brother and sister,which is predictably disastrous. Jimmy ruptures himself lifting a bag of sand at work and has to go to hospital for an operation. The nurse on his ward is a friend of Ann and it becomes clear that,after what Ann has told them about him,none of the nurses like him. After the operation he returns home but is on very strong pain-killers,giving him a high so that,without realising just what he is doing,he writes a letter to Siobhan,proposing marriage though fortunately she knows he does not mean it. Alex,meanwhile,believes - wrongly - that he has gained psychic powers. Yet again Jimmy and Kev lose out in the weekly pub quiz to Siobhan and her friends so Jimmy recruits Diana to his team and at last they win - on a tie-break. However when Diana discovers that her wrong answer was judged correct she goes to the pub to return the prize money,meeting Siobhan. The two women get drunk and get on famously,largely by agreeing about Jimmy's short-comings. He is not amused and ends up by insulting Siobhan. Jimmy's van is subject to a break-in and all his keys,including those for the house,are stolen. Diana insists that he has all the locks changed but he prevaricates. However,returning home he finds that Diana has gone behind his back and had the locks changed,involving his having to break into the house. Inevitably he is arrested as a burglar and Diana and the children have to vouch for him. On the eleventh anniversary of her husband Patrick's death Diana takes Jimmy and the kids to visit his grave and is taken aback to find that somebody has left a bunch of red roses on it. Assuming that Patrick was having an affair during the marriage Diana asks Jimmy to track down the sender via the florists. It turns out that Sheila,the lady in question,was also married to a man called Patrick and her son-in-law put the roses on the wrong grave. Jimmy meets Siobhan's father David and they go to dinner with Diana. Diana and David seem to hit it off and start dating but she feels smothered by the gifts - including a giant teddy bear - that he sends her and asks Jimmy to break things off for her, Unfortunately Jimmy leads David to believe he is breaking with Siobhan and it is left to Diana to brutally dump David,who is not at all concerned. Alex's family tree of what would happen if David and Diana married is thus redundant. When Kev gets engaged Jimmy fears that Siobhan may also have marriage in mind and tries to show her how much he lacks commitment. However,when she accepts this and dumps him he stages a romantic proposal on the London Eye,only for Siobhan to turn him down,saying they both deserve better. Diana meanwhile meets Mark,an old flame,via the Internet and goes on a date,but is horrified to find how much he has aged. And Molly discovers that Aunt Daisy,the agony aunt she has been consulting,is actually Alex. Howard,Ann's colleague and new lover,returns from Africa to raise funds for their relief work. Whilst everybody else warms to him Jimmy dislikes him on first sight and matters are not helped when he says that he and Ann want the children to go to live in Africa with them. Diana and Jimmy are dead set against this as,eventually are Molly,who has got a job in a chip shop,and Alex. Diana's friend Pam offers her cheap tickets for the Bayreuth Festival and asks if Diana can recommend anybody to decorate her home so Diana sends Jimmy and Kev to her. After hearing an angry message on Pam's answer phone Kev is convinced that she is a murderer though Jimmy is dismissive. However,after she has paid them Pam is arrested as being a notorious fraudster and both Jimmy's cheque and Diana's tickets are found to be duds. Alex meanwhile stands as head prefect but is disqualified after being caught bribing pupils to vote for him. When Diana loses the school time-tables she has prepared for the year Jimmy comes to her aid by buying a second hand lap top computer from work-mate Kev. However it turns out that the computer was not Kev's to sell and its owner wants it back,causing Diana to lose her schedules a second time. And Jimmy is ripped off literally when Siobhan persuades him to let her practice her waxing skills on him. After accidentally seeing Diana in the nude Jimmy is taken aback to discover that she has a tattoo of a rose on her leg,which was done when she was young. Molly immediately wants a tattoo,which Jimmy and Diana oppose and unsuccessfully try reverse psychology to see if this will dissuade her. It does not but she is refused one by the tattooist as she is too young. Alex meanwhile is perturbed to learn that a psychology assessment marks him out as ideal material to be an accountant. Whilst Diana is appalled that Molly has a T-shirt bearing the legend 'Slut Queen' Jimmy volunteers to build an arch in the house for her. He enlists Alex's help as a learning exercise after his school report states that the boy has potential but needs to improve his attention span. It involves his having to cancel a weekend in Brighton with Siobhan but he discovers that Siobhan,knowing him to be unreliable,expected as much and has made plans of her own. Jimmy agrees to letting his children have a party but fears Diana's disapproval so his girlfriend Siobhan suggests he take Diana out for the evening. They go to a sea food restaurant where Diana sees Laurence,a colleague with whom she has been having an affair,with a much younger woman,and counters by claiming that Jimmy is her toy boy. However she is suspicious of Jimmy's behaviour and returns home to find the party,now fancy dress,in full swing. When nurse Ann Venables has to go to Africa to help out after a flood,she asks her lazy ex-husband,handyman Jimmy,to move in with their teen-aged children Molly and Alex. However Ann's organized mother Diana,a teacher,looks down on Jimmy and his parenting skills and also moves in.

After a period of ill health, Miss Marple leaves St. Mary Mead for the tropical Caribbean paradise of St. Honorï¿½, where an English couple - Tim and Molly Kendall - run a quaint little resort called the Golden Palms. Among the many guests, which include the innocuous Hillingdons, their unseemly American friends the Dysons, and gruff business tycoon Jason Rafiel, is garrulous Major Palgrave, who is friendly to all - much to everyone's chagrin. When Palgrave launches into his infamous storytelling routine one evening, only Miss Marple takes enough interest to listen. Talk quickly turns to murder, and Palgrave coyly asks her if she'd like to see a photograph of a serial killer. But before he can pull it out, he sees something - or someone - and quickly changes the subject. After a night of excessive drink and entertainment, including a voodoo show, Palgrave is found dead in his room the next morning - the cause of death being a heart attack. Sensing his death is no coincidence, Miss Marple takes it upon herself to unravel the secrets of the guests of St. Honorï¿½, intent on finding the one person with a secret worth killing for. But more victims will be claimed, and one suspect will slowly lose their grip on sanity altogether before this Caribbean mystery will be solved. The residents of Chipping Cleghorn are astonished to read an advert in the local newspaper that a murder will take place the following Friday at 7:30 p.m. at Little Paddocks, the home of Letitia Blacklock. A group gathers and at that precise moment, the lights go out and a young hotel employee, Rudi Schertz, is shot. The police assume he had placed the ad and planned it as a robbery, but for Miss Marple it's not that obvious. She believes that the killer was likely one of the people in the room. When two of those present the evening of the murder are subsequently killed, it is left to Miss Marple to unravel a complex series of relationships and false identities, all centered around Randall Goedler a wealthy industrialist who had died 10 years earlier. When Rex Fortescue dies while sitting at his desk in the City, it's determined that he was in fact poisoned. He was married to a much younger wife, who now stands to inherit. His son Percival, a partner in the family firm, was a disappointment to him and a daughter, Elaine, hasn't amounted to much. Another son, Lance, had a falling out with his father many years before and relocated to East Africa. He suddenly appears soon after his father's death claiming that they had reconciled and been invited by him to return to England with an offer to rejoin the firm. Miss Marple takes a particular interest in the case when her former maid Gladys, now working in the Fortescue household, is also murdered. She soon learns that the elder Fortescue had received veiled threats for some time and that they might have something to do with a long ago business deal that made his initial fortune. Miss Marple finds herself on a bit of a holiday and staying at the very posh Bertram's Hotel, where she stayed as a child and for which she has very fond memories. Things take a sinister turn when a hotel maid, Tilly Rice, is found strangled on the roof. Miss Marple can't help but investigate but is assisted by Jane Cooper, also a hotel maid, who is in fact a younger version of Miss Marple. When an attempt is made on the life of a hotel guest, Elvira Blake the two Janes work together to find the motive and the identity of the killer. When Tommy and Tuppence visit an elderly aunt in her nursing home, Tuppence is concerned by the odd behavior of some staff and residents. So when Tuppence hears about Aunt Ada's sudden death and the disappearance of her friend Mrs Lancaster, she realizes her concerns were right. Tuppence meets Miss Marple and together they follow a path of clues that lead them to the Norfolk village of Farrell St Edmund, where they find a community guarding an array of secrets. Only by getting to the bottom of these secrets do they begin to unravel the truth about the mystery of Aunt Ada's death and Mrs Lancaster's disappearance. While consoling her recently widowed friend Marjorie, Miss Marple crosses paths with the handsome Mike Rogers, a young worker with a penchant for daydreaming about his future, more specifically about the perfect house he would live in, built on the eerily beautiful Gypsy's Acre. When Mike meets and marries the ethereal American heiress Ellie Goodman, his luck changes, and with the help of his old friend and rising architect Robbie Hayman, Mike's dream house is finally built, despite the repeated warnings from Esther Lee, a local gypsy, that Gypsy's Acre is cursed ground. Miss Marple, however, senses that danger really is near at hand, especially when frightening incidents plague Mike and Ellie, culminating in an injury that leads to the arrival of Ellie's mysterious Swedish friend, Greta. But when Ellie herself meets a tragic end, Miss Marple and Mike are faced with a chilling reality: that, perhaps, supernatural nightmares truly can exist, and that - as William Blake once wrote - some are born to endless night... When old family friend Louisa Oxley visits Miss Marple one stormy night seeking help, Miss Marple decides to send her and her son, Archie, to safety at the labyrinthine estate of Greenshaw's Folly, owned by Miss Marple's good friend Katherine Greenshaw, an eccentric botanist and the last surviving Greenshaw. Louisa becomes Miss Greenshaw's secretary, and quickly attracts the attention of the gardener Alfred Pollock and actor Nat Fletcher. Things turn sinister when the Folly's faithful butler, Walter Cracken, is killed in what appears to be a tragic accident. Then a guest at the house, Horace Bindler, disappears without a trace. Miss Marple is convinced all is unwell, and her suspicions are confirmed when Miss Greenshaw herself is brutally murdered. Suspects are everywhere, but none can imagine the secrets, both past and present, which Miss Marple uncovers. While traveling on a train to London, Miss Marple is told by a woman she has never met, Lavinia Pinkerton, that she is certain there have been two murders in her village of Wychwood. When Lavinia dies in what is purported to be an accident - she fell, or was pushed, down the escalator in a tube station - Miss Marple decides to visit Wychwood and see what she can find. As Miss Marple is apt to say, one English village is like another and Wychwood has its secrets like any other. The first woman to die was Florie Gibbs who, despite being experienced in such things, supposedly ate poison mushrooms she picked herself. The second was the local vicar who failed to wear his mask when using poison near his beehives. The third is a young woman who, it is said, accidentally drank hat dye instead of her cough medicine. Miss Marple finds a clue that points to a motive with origins many years before and a secret someone will do anything, including murder, to keep hidden. Miss Marple is called upon to solve her most perplexing case yet. Upon his death, financier John Rafiel asks her to solve a murder. Only problem is that the murder may or may not have place as yet and the victim is unknown. All that he has given her is two tickets on the Daffodil Tour Company's Mystery Tour. It soon becomes obvious that others on the tour were also "selected" by Mr. Rafiel. Jane Marple, assisted by her nephew Raymond West, concludes that the case must be related to that of Verity Hunt, a young woman who in 1939 was running away from an overattentive landlord and eventually disappeared. When a member of the tour dies mysteriously, she also realizes that someone is desperate to keep a deep, dark secret. Miss Marple is invited to the wedding of a friend, but the gaieties are interrupted when a stranger arrives; he provides the missing evidence which proves that the black sheep of the family, Jacko, was wrongfully hanged for murder. This raises the question of who in the household did kill the cold-hearted mistress of the house two years previously. As usual, Miss Marple is needed to uncover the hatred, jealousy, lust etc. behind the family's facade and sort out the threads of the mystery. Miss Jane Marple is asked to help Gwenda, a wealthy young woman who has bought a house on the English coast, only to experience disturbing visions. Thanks to Miss Marple's investigations, Gwenda discovers that, instead of spending all her life in India, she had lived in the house as a child. The visions are actually flashes of memory - and she realizes she witnessed the murder of a beautiful woman named "Helen". While visiting her friend Dermot in Little Ambrose, Miss Marple is drawn into investigating the death of Eddie Seward, whom she'd met on the bus and who is found having apparently drowned in the river.Within a few days however, there is a second suspicious death, that of Mary Pritchard who seems to have died from fright. She was disliked by many and had recently caused a scene when her husband George was inaugurated as the Captain of the local golf club. Even Dermot disliked her as did her sister Philippa, who was once engaged to George, whom she described as the love of her life. Phillipa ended up marrying George's brother, Lewis Pritchard, and they are constantly having money problems. A third death - this time one of George Pritchard's former mistresses - convinces Inspector Somerset that George, who conveniently confesses, is the murderer. Miss Marple thinks otherwise and sets out to prove it. A young woman's corpse is dumped in the library of Gossington Hall, home of Jane Marple's friend Dolly Bantry and her husband Arthur. Pompous Chief Constable Melchett suspects a connection with Basil Blake, an arty young man who lives locally but Blake is dismissive when Melchett visits him. Then Superintendent Harper rings from the coastal town of Danemouth. Ruby Keane, a young girl employed as a dancer at the Majestic Hotel there, has gone missing, and her cousin Josie Turner identifies the corpse as Ruby's. Ruby is in favour with millionaire Conway Jefferson, whose own son and daughter were killed in a wartime air raid, and he wants to adopt her. His son-in-law Mark Gaskell, and daughter-in-law Adelaide react variously to the news. Miss Marple is convinced that the solution to Ruby's murder may be found at the hotel and she and Dolly book into a suite to investigate. There is no shortage of suspects, not only family members but the handsome Raymond Starr, another of the hotel's dance professionals, and George Bartlett, the last person to see Ruby before her disappearance. Hollywood star Marina Gregg leaves Los Angeles for the picturesque countryside of St Mary Mead. Having taken up residence at Gossington Hall with her dashing young English husband, film director Jason Rudd, his secretary, Ella Blunt and Marina's exclusive personal assistant, Hailey Preston, it's not long before she becomes lady of the manor. When the glamorous couple decide to throw a benefit for the St John Ambulance, the grounds are abuzz with curious locals including previous owner of Gossington Hall, Dolly Bantry. But when a local fan, Heather Badcock consumes a poisoned daiquiri, Marina finds herself starring in a real-life mystery - supported by Miss Marple and Inspector Hewitt, who suspect that the lethal cocktail was intended for someone else. But who? If it was meant for Marina, then why? When troubled war veteran Jerry Burton and his sister Joanna relocate to the quiet little village of Lymstock in order to allow Jerry to recuperate from injuries received in what he claims is a motorcycle accident, they are expecting nothing more than country sleepiness and tedium. Much to their surprise, however, they find themselves embroiled in the middle of scandal and secrets; someone is sending vicious poison-pen letters to the residents. A local dignitary has already taken his own life over the letters, and it's not long before local gossip Mona Symmington also commits suicide after receiving a letter. But when the letter-writer apparently resorts to murder, Jerry finds his curiosity stoked despite himself, and he's not the only one; Miss Jane Marple is also in Lymstock, and she's decided that it's long past time someone got to the bottom of this unpleasant business. Colonel Lucius Protheroe is probably the least-liked individual in St Mary Mead. All resent his superior and demanding attitude. So, when he is found dead in the vicarage study, there is no end of suspects. His wife Ann was having an affair with a local artist, Lawrence Redding. His daughter Lettice bridled under his strict rule. There is also the vicar and his assistant, whom Protheroe suspected of stealing church funds. Finally, there is the mysterious Mrs. Lester with whom he clearly had some previous connection. Jane Marple, recuperating at home from a sprained ankle, had a bird's eye view of all the comings and goings at the vicarage around the time of the murder and she gladly assists Inspector Slack in solving the crime. Miss Marple is shocked when she receives a note from an old friend,Father Gorman only to read in the newspaper the very same day that he was murdered. He had attended a dying woman, Mrs. Davis, who died the previous evening and it was while he was on his way home that he was apparently attacked. The police have put it down to a mugging but the letter Miss Marple received from him intrigues her: a list of surnames and a quote from the bible. The policeman in charge of the case, Inspector Lejeune is skeptical about it all being a murder but when Miss Marple inspects Mrs. Davis' rooms, she finds an identical list to that sent to her by Father Gorman and also a reference to the Pale Horse Inn in Much Deeping, Hampshire. She soon checks into the inn and pursues her own investigation. A lavish weekend party sees Miss Marple accompany Lady Virginia Revel to her family home of Chimneys - a house which was once prized for its diplomatic gatherings until a rare diamond was stolen from the premises over twenty years ago. The tenacious career politician, George Lomax, has persuaded Virginia's father, Lord Caterham, to host an evening for an important Austrian Count, Ludwig Von Stainach. Virginia, the daughter of Miss Marple's late cousin, must decide by the end of the weekend whether to accept a marriage proposal from George Lomax or to follow her heart and the courtship of another more adventurous suitor, Anthony Cade. Dismayed by the odd array of guests, including socialist spinster Miss Blenkinsopp, Caterham's formidable eldest daughter Bundle and the quietly inscrutable maidservant Treadwell, Lomax castigates his affable assistant Bill Eversleigh, who also has a soft spot for Virginia. It becomes apparent that Count Ludwig has taken a personal interest in Chimneys and a contract for the sale of the house is drawn up with Caterham. That same evening, in the middle of the night, the house guests are stirred from their beds by security and the Count cannot be found. The sound of a gunshot is heard from a secret passageway in the house and Count Ludwig is found dead in the arms of Anthony Cade. Why is Cade at Chimneys? And is Virginia's suitor being framed for murder? A Chief Inspector arrives from Scotland Yard to investigate, enlisting Miss Marple's help. Together they discover a coded message in the pocket of the dead Count which could hold the key to the mystery. But when the bones of a young servant, murdered over twenty years ago, are uncovered Miss Marple begins to realize that the secret of Chimneys is darker than even she had realized. When Clive Trevelyan - Member of Parliament, war hero and heir apparent to Prime Minister Winston Churchill- is killed, Miss Marple sets about to solve the case. Trevelyan has made his fortune many years before in Egypt having secretly uncovered a lost tomb. He is killed during a major snowstorm when there are no police available. There are several possible suspects including Trevelyan's ward, James Pearson and his fiancï¿½e Emily Trefusis; his political agent, John Enderby; a journalist Charles Burnaby; a visiting American Martin Zimmerman; and several other apparently disinterested parties. A convict has also escaped from Dartmoor prison. Miss Marple concludes that Trevalyan's murder is related to his days in Egypt and sets about to identify the murderer. Miss Marple is requested to help her old friend Carrie-Louise, the loving wife of benign philanthropist Lewis Serrocold. Carrie-Louise is slowly poisoned by an unknown hand,and her husband and her sister Ruth want absolutely to save her from this dark menace. Miss Marple is visiting an old school friend, Lady Camilla Tressilian, along with an eclectic group: Neville Strange and his wife Kay, his former wife Audrey and her childhood friend and cousin Thomas Royde, Ted Latimer (who is something of a gigolo and very attracted to Kay Strange) and finally Freddie Treves, a retired solicitor. When Treves is found dead the day after a dinner party at Lady Tressilian's home and Lady Tressilian herself is found bludgeoned to death a short time later, Miss Marple must sort through the complex set of relationships among all the players, and determine what role the tale of a child's crime may have had to play in the deaths. While visiting her friend Marjorie Attfield, Miss Marple learns that her son Bobby had recently found a body, identified as a Mr. Pritchard, on the cliff side. He's received a letter asking him to appear at the enquiry but it seems to be a wild goose chase meant to keep him away from the real enquiry taking place elsewhere. Now accompanied by a friend, Frankie Derwent, they trace the dead man to nearby Castle Savage, home to a dysfunctional family with great deal of money. The family patriarch, Jack Savage, had died not long ago and the dead man had some connection to the Savages. But what is the key to solving the mystery of Pritchard's last words to Bobby as he lay dying: "Why didn't they ask Evans?". Amateur detective Miss Jane Marple investigates the murder of a young woman whose body is found in the library at Gossington Hall, home of Colonel and Mrs. Arthur Bantry. Based on book 2 (of 5) of the Agatha Christie novels, this limited British TV series chronicles the adventures of Tommy and Prudence "Tuppence" Beresford as the duo take over operations of a London detective agency. Each installment of the show follows one of the mini-mysteries from the "Partners in Crime" short stories, seeing the newlyweds hot on the trail of missing jewels, poltergeists, poisoned chocolates, and more. Tommy and Tuppence decide to go to a fancy dress ball after reading what they interpret as a coded message in the personals column of the newspaper. What they find is a dead woman, stabbed in the chest. The woman is identified as Lady Vere Merivale, a well-known socialite. Inspector Marriott arrests Captain Bingo Hale, Lady Merivale's lover, but the Beresfords believe him to be innocent. Tuppence Beresford is bored to tears and longs for their adventurous days of not so long ago. She is thrilled when husband Tommy announces that he has bought Blunt's International Detective Agency on a 6-month trial basis. Client's are a bit of a rarity but Tuppence's solution to getting their first paying customer leads to a second who hires them to locate her house guest's missing pink pearls. The pearl had gone missing after an evening of bridge but the list of suspects narrows when one of the guests admits to kleptomania. Tommy and Tuppence find themselves working for the US Ambassador to Great Britain who tells them a strange tale about a misplaced bag. On his recent return to the UK, a bag identical to his, but belonging to someone else, was delivered to his home. The correct bags were delivered soon after but when he approached the other party involved, they denied ever getting the wrong bag. What, the Ambassador asks, would someone have wanted with his bag that contained nothing other than his boots? Interviewing several of the passengers who traveled on the same ship as the Ambassador, the detectives conclude that they are dealing with a case of smuggling, but who are the culprits? When renowned explorer Gabriel Stavansson returns two weeks early from his latest expedition, his fiancï¿½e Hermione is nowhere to be found. He approaches Tommy and Tuppence when he finds that Hermione's friends and relatives are less than forthcoming about her whereabouts. Their investigation leads them to a clinic where they think the girl is being held against her will. The situation isn't quite what they had imagined however. Monica Dean has purchased a large home and has turned it into a sort of exclusive hotel for paying guests. The only problem is that the house seems to be haunted as on at least two occasions, guests have had their windows opened, the furniture smashed and their clothes torn to shreds. Tommy and Tuppence travel to the home and learn that there a valuable secret buried on the grounds. So valuable in fact that someone will stop at nothing to scare Miss Dean into selling. Inspector Marriott asks the Beresfords to assist him in rounding up a gang of upper class forgers. Forged notes have been showing up in the West End and the police feel they don't have the class of individuals needed to infiltrate this type of group. The police suspect Major Laidlaw and his French wife Marguerite but have little evidence to go on. They focus on the goings on at a posh private club but Tuppence correctly concludes that this case is far more dangerous that they imagined. Lois Hargreaves calls on Blunt's detective agency after someone sends her a box of chocolates laced with a mild, though not lethal, amount of arsenic. The Beresford's agree to travel to her home the next day but that morning, read in the newspaper that many members of Miss Hargreaves household were killed the previous afternoon from eating poisoned sandwiches served at tea. There are several suspects, including Lois' best friend from school, a cousin who would inherit a great if she died and several members of the household staff who are acting as if they have something to hide. Having been unsuccessful in solving their most recent case, Tommy and Tuppence find themselves trying to solve the murder of Gilda Glenn, a well-known stage actress. She was known to have entered a local house but the occupants have sound explanations for where they were at the time of the killing and the local policeman was keeping a close eye on the house, as the owner was afraid of burglars. When Tommy's wartime pal Bulger Estcourt is arrested, Tommy decides to stage a re-creation. With few clients coming into the agency, Tommy suggests the he and Tuppence should go out to the crime. Specifically, he focuses on the murder of a Captain Antony Cecil whose body is found at the Sunningdale golf course. Cecil was well known and a regular on the links who had played a round of golf with several others the previous day. Arrested for his murder is Doris Evans who claimed that Cecil, whom she had met the previous month at the cinema, had invited her to lunch on the day of his death but then threatened her, at which point she ran off. Tommy is convinced she is innocent and he and Tuppence set off to piece together what really happened. Tommy and Tuppence are hired by Monty Jones to help him win a bet he has made with Una Drake. She has bet that she can produce an unbreakable alibi that will put her in two places at the same time. She subsequently provides him with information that puts her dining alone in a posh London restaurant and at a hotel 200 miles away in Torquay on the same evening. Visiting the London restaurant, the headwaiter vaguely confirms that she is a regular and that she very likely was in the restaurant on the evening in question. When they visit Torquay, they find the hotel receptionist, waiter and room maid all remember her quite well. When an acquaintance of Drake's is killed, our intrepid detectives wonder is there is perhaps another reason she wanted an airtight alibi. This whodunit series based on Agatha Christie's crime novels and short stories, is named after its star sleuth, Hercule Poirot, a famous former Belgian policeman, who settled for good in London after the war, soon so famous as an infallible private detective that he becomes a society figure in his own right. In each episode Poirot gets to solve a crime mystery -mostly murder(s)- for a paying client or otherwise catching his attention, generally along with his faithful English sidekick Captain Hastings and/or his Scotland yard 'friendly rival' Detective Chief Inspector Japp. His friend, solicitor Gilbert Entwhistle, asks Hercule Poirot to help solve a riddle and a murder. The riddle has to do with Richard Abernethie's will. It would seem that he changed his will immediately prior to his death, distributing all of his wealth equally among family members but excluding George Abernethie who, in all previous wills, had been the sole beneficiary. The two had supposedly argued recently, but Entwhistle suspects the new will may be a forgery. As for the murder, he would like Poirot to investigate the death of Cora Galaccio, who was violently beaten to death the day after Richard's funeral. She too had inherited from the suspect will, but are the two deaths and the will all part of a greater plot, or is there a simpler explanation? Syria, 1937: Hercule Poirot is one of several people present at an archaeological dig to find the skull of St John the Baptist, led by the exuberant Lord Boynton and his loyal son Leonard. The enterprise has been financed by Boynton's rich, rude and overbearing American wife. She bullies her three adopted children, Carol, Jinny and Raymond, as well as the family's nanny. Sarah King, a young English doctor, falls for Raymond and would love to tear him from his mother's apron-strings, and another doctor, Dr Gerard, takes an interest in Jinny, as does a Polish nun, who, with Jinny, is subject to an attack - by white slavers, according to the independent travel-writer Dame Celia Westholme. A mysterious young American, Jefferson Cope, whose link to the Boyntons seems tenuous, completes the group. Only his Lordship has any love for his wife so that, when she is found stabbed to death one blisteringly hot afternoon, Poirot has more than his fair share of suspects to interrogate. Hercule Poirot finds himself investigating the murder of his dinner host, Mr. Shaitana, who was stabbed in the heart while his guests played bridge. There are eight guests and Poirot finds himself in the company of three other investigators. The foursome interview each of the other guests in turn but make little headway until Poirot manages to reconstruct the various bridge hands played at the suspects' table. In doing so, he is able to identify one particular action that leads him to identify the killer. When the middle-Eastern country of Ramat is over-run by anti-monarchist revolutionaries, the surviving heir to the throne, Princess Shaista, is spirited away to safety in a small girls' school, Meadowbank, which is run by the progressive Miss Bulstrode. However, when the bullying games mistress Miss Springer is found stabbed through the chest with a javelin, it appears that Meadowbank may not be the haven it promised to be. As Poirot assists Inspector Kelsey, they begin to find that some of the staff may not be quite what they appear, a situation which is compounded when another teacher, Mademoiselle Blanche is found dead and Princess Shaista is kidnapped from the school. With the princess' life in peril, and the prized rubies of Ramat missing, it is up to Poirot to discover who is the cat among the pigeons. Still mourning the untimely death of his wife, Bella, Hastings is summoned to Styles Court in Styles St. Mary by his old friend Poirot. It is the country manor where, thirty years previously, he and Poirot had first met in England and where they had also solved their first murder mystery together. Now, Styles has changed hands and is being run as a modest post-war guest house, and it is here that Hastings makes a gut-wrenching discovery: Poirot's health has taken a turn for the worse. The Belgian detective is now old, gaunt, arthritic, and confined to a wheelchair as he battles a weak heart. But his little gray cells are as active as ever, which is why Poirot has called him to Styles in the first place - a murderer is in their midst, and may be ready to strike again. He asks Hastings to be his eyes and ears about the place, for Poirot does not know who is likely to be the killer's next victim. Being as observant and vigilant as possible, Hastings takes stock of his fellow company, which includes Styles' elderly owners Daisy and Colonel Toby Luttrell, melancholy spinster Elizabeth Cole, charming aristocrat Sir William Boyd Carrington, perceptive birdwatcher Stephen Norton, dashing womanizer Major Allerton, introverted chemist Dr John Franklin and his unpleasant wife Barbara, Mrs Franklin's caretaker Nurse Craven, and, most significantly, his fiercely independent daughter Judith, currently working as Dr Franklin's laboratory assistant. Any one of these people could be a killer, but Hastings is at a loss as to exactly who, especially since he seems more interested in reconnecting with his estranged daughter and protecting her from indecent cads like Allerton. But soon, the murderer's presence becomes apparent: first, Colonel Luttrell nearly kills his wife in a supposed shooting accident, and then Barbara Franklin dies after ingesting a toxic alkaloid that her husband has been researching. Just when a solution seems in sight, Norton is found dead from a gunshot wound. Who is behind these cold-blooded acts, and for what reason? How much has Poirot been withholding from Hastings, and were any of these events truly preventable? What has Judith been hiding from her father, and can the two be reconciled despite their differences? What role does Shakespeare play in the proceedings? And, finally, can Poirot solve his final case in spite of his deteriorating health, or will the curtain come down on him before he can bring a ruthless killer to justice? With summer in the air, wealthy squire Sir George Stubbs and his fragile, childlike wife Hattie plan a grand fï¿½te for their Devonshire neighbors to celebrate their recent acquisition of Nasse House. Fancy dress, fortune telling, and a coconut shy are all scheduled, as well as a murder hunt designed by mystery novelist Ariadne Oliver. But Mrs Oliver is convinced something is amiss, and asks Hercule Poirot to attend the festivities as a means to put her mind at rest. Poirot scrutinizes the eclectic lot, which includes officious politicos, a put-upon secretary, a rakish architect, warring holidaymakers, a garrulous ferryman, an urbane foreigner, and Nasse's former matriarch, now content to be a humble lodger. They certainly have secrets to hide, but are any of them likely murderers? Or victims? When Mrs Oliver's fears are realized, however, the events are far from how she imagined them to unfold. A murder occurs as anticipated, but bizarrely, the victim is Marlene Tucker, a local Girl Guide who was assigned the role of the victim in Mrs Oliver's murder game! Her seemingly senseless death precipitates an even greater intrigue when Hattie Stubbs vanishes into thin air, clothes and all. Then the ferryman dies in a seemingly unrelated accident. What could all of this mean? Was Marlene silenced as a witness? Was Hattie abducted against her will? Was Mrs Oliver unknowingly manipulated by an unscrupulous murderer? And how does Sir George's hideous folly figure into the mystery, if at all? Poirot is on the case, determined to put the follies of Nasse House to rest once and for all. Poirot is outbid at an auction for an antique mirror by the dislikeable Gervais Chevenix, who requests Poirot's attendance at his country home as he believes he is being defrauded by a business associate, John Lake. Poirot arrives at the Chevenix house with Hastings and meets Chevenix's wife Vanda, an eccentric who believes in reincarnation and predicts a death in the household, his adopted daughter Ruth and her cousin Hugo,a struggling manufacturer of tubular steel furniture, who will inherit Chevenix's money if they marry and Miss Lingard, a secretary helping Chevenix research a book he is writing. Hugo is engaged to Susan and Ruth has already married Lake in secret. As the household are dressing for dinner, the butler sounds the gong to summon them, and then a shot rings out. Vanda's prophecy has come true and her husband has been murdered. After spending a bit of a holiday in Paris, Poirot finds himself on a flight to London with an odd assortment of people, some of whom he had met during his stay. When one of the passengers, Madame Gisele, is murdered during the flight by a poisoned dart, Poirot is asked by Inspector Japp of Scotland Yard to assist with the investigation. Gisele was a well-known moneylender with penchant towards blackmail. When Lady Horbury denies knowing the dead woman - which Poirot knows is false - the police clearly have their prime suspect. Poirot however, sees a far more complex plot to gain access to the victims money. While on their honeymoon in Egypt, newlyweds Simon Doyle and Linett Ridgeway are constantly harassed by Simon's ex-fiancï¿½e Jackie De Bellefort who feels her ex-best friend has stolen the love of her life. A holidaying Hercules Poirot counsels Jackie to put an end to her antics, fearing that all of this can only end in tragedy. When one of the passengers is killed while on a cruise down the Nile, Poirot must sift through an odd assortment of passengers, all of whom may have something to hide. There is Linett's financial advisor from the US, her French maid who clearly has something to hide, the Austrian doctor who keeps mostly to himself and the left leaning philosopher who despises the rich. A bored Hercule Poirot announces that he is going to retire and suggests that he and Captain Hastings go to the seaside for a short holiday. While there, they meet a pleasant young woman who is delivering a set of miniature portraits to an American buyer on behalf of her aunt, an antiques dealer. When they arrive at their destination she is shocked to find that the miniatures are missing and that the American had already bought them from an elderly lady more than an hour before. As Poirot has retired he leaves the case in the hands of Hastings who slowly puts the facts together and not surprisingly comes to the wrong conclusion. In the end, it is left to Poirot to suggest the solution to the crime and brings all of the parties together for an interesting lunch. Hastings is invited by his friend Charles Arundell to be at hand when he tries to break a water speed record on a Berkshire country lake, but his boat's engine fails him. At a subsequent reception at the estate of Charles' well-to-do aunt, Poirot and the other guests witness her refusal to continue to underwrite Charles' expensive hobby, and he threatens her. Later, when she is almost killed in a freak accident involving her pet fox terrier Bob, she confides to Poirot that she suspects a family member of trying to kill her to gain part of her estate. The detective advises her to disinherit her grasping relatives and name a friend as beneficiary. Despite this precaution, she dies abruptly under questionable circumstances, but the local authorities refuse to authorize an autopsy. Suspecting foul play, Poirot looks to his wits as well as the Arundell dog, who remains a silent witness to murder. Ariadne Oliver is accosted by the unpleasant Mrs Burton-Cox, whose son Desmond has hopes of marrying Ariadne's beautiful goddaughter Celia Ravenscroft. But Mrs Burton-Cox will not give her blessings to the match until she learns the truth of the deaths of Celia's parents, who were found shot to death on the grounds of their estate a decade before. Were they murdered, or was it a suicide pact? If they were murdered, who shot whom? Despite being insulted by the woman's impertinence, Ariadne is nevertheless drawn to the cold case by curiosity, and resolves to find out the truth when she is persuaded by Celia herself. When she turns to Poirot for assistance, however, she finds him already preoccupied investigating the murder of an elderly psychiatrist who was the father of a personal friend. So Ariadne sets out to solve the Ravenscroft affair herself, with the mantra that 'elephants can remember' - no matter how much time has passed and how much people who were acquainted with the Ravenscrofts have aged, memories remain unchanged. However, the memories of the people Ariadne interviews are not as reliable as she has hoped, and soon the investigation takes a sinister turn when Desmond's life is threatened by an unknown entity. When Poirot realizes that his investigation is inextricably linked with Mrs Oliver's, the two join forces. With the help of a wigmaker, the evidence of a clever dog, and a French connection to the Ravenscroft case, Poirot is able to penetrate the fog of memory to uncover the truth of two long-ago deaths, and how that tragic story inspired the present-day killer whom he himself has been hunting. Recovering from a sudden collapse, Poirot finds little comfort in doctor's orders confining him to a strict regimen at an island health resort with Captain Hastings. However, better medicine is to be found in the murder of another guest, a famous film actress, and a long list of suspects. Fourteen years after her mother, Caroline Crale, was hanged for the murder of her artist father Amyas Crale, Lucy Crale asks Hercule Poirot to investigate her father's death. She is convinced that her mother was innocent but is prepared to accept the truth, whatever that may be. Poirot visits in turn all five persons present when the murder took place including Amyas' best friend, Philip Blake, who was visiting the Crales when Amyas was killed; Philip's brother Meredith from whom Caroline supposedly stole the poison used to kill her husband; Elsa Greer, who was sitting for a portrait and with whom Amyas was supposedly in love; Caroline's half sister Angela who despised Amyas but believed her sister to be innocent; and Miss Williams, the governess. Having heard the tale from five different perspectives, Poirot reunites them all to identify the murderer. The estranged, elderly Gascoigne brothers are found dead within days of each other. The one, Anthony, died in his home in Brighton in circumstances that give no cause for suspicion. The other brother, Henry, an eccentric, reclusive painter, however, has fallen downstairs and been dead for some time before his death is discovered. Poirot had been eating in the same restaurant as Henry just before the death. Henry had been pointed out as a creature of habit, a man who always ate exactly the same meal on every visit. On this last occasion, though, he had had a completely different set of courses, which leads Poirot to suspect foul play. When Ariadne Oliver and her friend, Judith Butler, attend a children's Halloween party in the village of Woodleigh Common, a young girl named Joyce Reynolds boasts of having witnessed a murder from years before. Joyce's story is heard by all the party, including her strange brother Leopold, the impeccable hostess Rowena Drake, her bookish son Edmund, and the local Reverend Cottrell. Mrs Whittaker, the church organist, and Frances Drake, Rowena's feisty daughter, are dismissive of her story, but later that evening Joyce's lifeless body is discovered face-down in the apple-bobbing bucket. At Mrs Oliver's behest, Poirot travels down to Woodleigh Common to investigate the murder. Although the local police and Joyce's stepmother dismiss the dead girl's claim, Poirot takes Joyce's story seriously. Mrs Goodbody, a gossiping charwoman, tells Poirot there have been a number of suspicious deaths in the village in recent years which Joyce could indeed have witnessed, and that old curses still haunt the village - a claim supported by the affable gardener, Michael Garfield. While Poirot is busy piecing together the facts, another child is found drowned in a river. He realizes that he needs to act quickly in order to save Judith's daughter, Miranda, who is also in danger. When Simeon Lee, a mean-spirited, tyrannical patriarch of a dysfunctional family, summons his offspring to his country manor house in Kent for Christmas, he employs Poirot to attend the reunion. The detective is not given a full explanation for his assignment, but he soon observes the palpable animosity, suspicion, and resentment among the three Lee sons. Also in attendance is the beautiful Pilar Estravados, the only surviving child of Lee's daughter, who recently passed away after living in exile in Spain. The ruthless Senior Lee, who made his fortune in the South African diamond fields, sadistically treats his progeny with deliberate cruelty and obviously relishes pitting one against the other. It comes as no surprise when the old man's throat is mysteriously cut in an apparently locked room, and although he was frail and wheelchair-bound, there appears to be evidence of a great struggle. Poirot is aided in his quest for a solution to the baffling mystery by Chief Inspector Japp and local Superinendent Sugden. When a series of apparently minor thefts plagues a university hostelry run by Miss Lemon's sister, Poirot is recruited to investigate. Celia Austin, a pharmacological major, confesses that she is a kleptomaniac and responsible for most of the thefts but denies stealing several objects including a stethoscope, light bulbs, and a student rucksack. Furthermore, she claims to know the other thief and vows to help return the missing items. Unfortunately someone substitutes an overdose of morphine for one of her sleeping powders, and she takes the identity of the thief to the grave. Japp connects the murderer's m.o. with a cold case he had investigated ten years earlier, but the prime suspect in that crime, a powerful statesman, now lies dying in a local hospital. Despite numerous obstacles, Poirot is able to link the killing to an international diamond smuggling ring but not before the murderer claims more victims. Poirot and Miss Lemon travel to Surrey to visit Miss Amelia Barrowby but arrive to learn that she has died during the night. Poirot had an odd encounter with her the previous day at a flower show when she made the odd gesture of giving him an empty seed packet. Upon returning home, he finds that she has written him seeking his assistance. Poirot suspects foul play and the pathologist confirms that the woman was poisoned with strychnine. Initial suspects are Miss Barrowby's niece and her husband, but when the dead woman's Russian companion runs away, Inspector Japp thinks he has the culprit. Poirot thinks otherwise. On his doctor's orders Poirot has gone to stay in the seaside resort of Brighton, where he is frequently mistaken for Lucky Len, who gives out money on behalf of a newspaper to people who recognize him. Poirot is staying at the Metropolitan hotel, as are Mr. Opalsen, a theatrical producer, and his wife who is an actress starring in a play at a local theatre. A set of valuable pearls which Mrs. Opalsen wears in the play is stolen from her room, and suspicion falls on her maid Celestine, who was in the room next door. Celestine loves Andrew, the impoverished young author of Mrs. Opalsen's play but they cannot afford to get married and she is accused of taking the jewels to finance their marriage. Poirot solves the case and unmasks the real culprit, being rewarded by Opalsen and getting a bonus when he identifies the real Lucky Len. Lady Edgware, the well-known stage actress Jane Wilkinson, has a dilemma in that her husband has consistently refused to give her a divorce. She asks Hercule Poirot to visit the man to see if there is any possibility of convincing him. Lord Edgware is nothing short of nasty, treating all those around him very badly. When he is found dead, there is no great surprise, but there certainly are a good number of suspects. The police believe Lady Edgware to be the culprit, but she has a cast-iron alibi, having attended a private dinner over the time her husband was killed. There is also the man's nephew, who would inherit his fortune, and his personal assistant, whom he treated very badly; and then there is the family butler, who clearly has his own interests at heart. James Bentley is tried for the murder of Abigail McGinty, the charwoman of Broadhinny who also took in Bentley as her lodger. The evidence is overwhelming, and soon after he is sentenced to hang. Superintendent Spence is not convinced of the man's guilt, and so he visits Poirot, asking him to look into the case. Poirot then heads off to the village, where he becomes the paying guest of Maureen and Major Johnnie Summerhayes. Ariadne Oliver, Poirot's novelist friend, has also come to Broadhinny to collaborate on a stage adaptation of one of her novels with dramatist Robin Upward. With the clue of a bottle of ink purchased by the dead woman shortly before her death, Poirot searches Mrs. McGinty's belongings and finds an edition of The Sunday Comet newspaper, where an article concerning two women connected with famous murders has been cut out. With the story are two photographs of the women. Poirot discovers that Mrs. McGinty had seen one of the photographs before, and knew to whom it belonged to. But which woman was this case connected with? Are any of the people living in Broadhinny related to these women, as one of their children? Or perhaps one of them is one of the actual women? The puzzle pieces begin to fit in, especially after Poirot is shoved into the path of an oncoming train by an unknown entity. But will the murderer strike again? While accompanying his friend Hastings to a dig in Iraq, Hercule Poirot becomes involved in the murder of an archaeologist's wife. The victim, Mrs. Leidner, had been receiving threatening letters signed by her first husband, who was known to have been killed in a train wreck. Did he survive? Was it his younger brother who was avenging his memory? Did Miss Johnson get rid of her rival for her employer's affections? Did Richard Carey kill the woman he publically announces that he hates? Is the French priest really who he pretends to be? And how many deaths will occur before Poirot unmasks the murderer? Poirot is enlisted by Japp to help solve a mystery that took place on Bonfire Night in a mews flat. A Mrs. Allen was found shot, apparently a suicide, but she was holding the gun that killed her in the wrong hand, and foul play is suspected. Furthermore, the ash-tray in the room contained the stubs of Turkish cigarettes smoked by one Major Eustace, a disreputable acquaintance.The victim was engaged to be married and seemingly had no cause to take her own life. Did she? Or was it murder in the mews? Poirot and Hastings are in Deauville, and Poirot is approached by business-man Paul Renaud concerning threats by Chileans. The next morning the maid finds Madame Renaud bound and gagged and her husband's corpse is later found on a nearby golf course. Giraud, a pompous French police officer, dismissive of Poirot's reputation, lays a wager with him. The detective who fails to catch the killer must make a sacrifice. Giraud will relinquish his trade mark pipe. Poirot must shave off his moustache. Railway director and fellow Belgian Monsieur Bouc secures Poirot a last minute berth on the Orient Express, returning to England from Istanbul. Ratchett, an abrasive American businessman, traveling with his valet and male secretary, tries to secure Poirot's services as he fears that his life is in danger. Poirot turns him down, but the next morning, whilst the train is stuck in a snowdrift in Serbia, Ratchett is found stabbed to death. There is vague talk of a man seen fleeing the train, but many of the passengers in Poirot's compartment do not appear to know either Ratchett or each other, so what could the motive be? Poirot, assisted by Bouc and Dr. Constantine, attempts to find out. Poirot pays what appears to be a routine visit to Dr. Morley, his dentist, but shortly after he leaves the clinic, the doctor is found dead with a gunshot wound to his temple, an apparent suicide. Poirot suspects foul play, and all those who entered the doctor's offices after Poirot left are suspect. They include Alaistair Blunt, a prominent and very influential bank director, Frank Carter, a young fascist thug with a personal grudge against Morley, Mr. Amberiotis, an enigmatic recent arrival from India suffering from a toothache, and Mabelle Sainsbury-Seale, a charity worker also recently returned from India. When Amberiotis is found dead in his hotel room from an overdose of Novocaine and Sainsbury-Seale disappears, Poirot rightly expands his list of suspects and connects the crime to events that occurred in India 12 years earlier. While enjoying a vacation at an exclusive resort on the Cornish coast, Poirot and Hastings meet beautiful young heiress Magdala Buckley. Known to her friends as Nick, she confides to them that she has recently survived several events that might have taken her life: a heavy-framed picture dropping on her head, a boulder falling off a cliff, and failed brakes. When Poirot notices a bullet hole in her hat, they put her under their protection and discover that her dead fiance, a noted aviator killed in a tragic accident, had named her as heir in his will. In the interim, his wealthy uncle is found to have died, making her the unexpected beneficiary of a great fortune. Poirot realizes this inheritance is the motive for continued attempts on her life, and in his quest for the the truth, he uncovers a tangled web of greed, forgery, drug addiction, fraud, poison, and murder. While on a Mediterranean cruise, Poirot is asked to investigate the murder of one of the passengers, Mrs. Clapperton who is found stabbed in the chest in her stateroom. She was somewhat haughty and generally disliked by the other passengers. Her henpecked husband, Colonel Clapperton, was ashore for the entire day with two other passengers. General Forbes, who admits to having been in love with the dead woman when they knew each other many years before, says he was having a nap. Then there is Miss Ellie Henderson, who is attracted to Colonel Clapperton but whose wife is in the way of any possible relationship. With everyone having a reasonable alibi, it is left to Poirot to find the killer. Distant cousins and childhood friends Elinor Carlisle and Roddy Welman are happily engaged to be married. One day Elinor receives an anonymous letter in the post, claiming that someone is trying their hardest to work their way into the affection, and subsequently also bank account, of her wealthy aunt Laura Welman, who is presently bedridden at her home since after a stroke and from whose death Elinor and Roddy both expect to inherit a large fortune. Not knowing what to make of the letter, the young couple eventually decide to pay Laura a visit in order to see for themselves what is really going on at the house. When they arrive, Elinor immediately becomes suspicious towards Mary Gerrard, the lodge keeper's daughter, recently returned to England after having studied in Europe and whom everyone else at the house seem to absolutely dote on. No one else however seem to share Elinor's suspicions or dislike of the young woman, and in particular not Roddy, whom Elinor one night discovers kissing Mary Gerrard in her aunt's drawing room. When Mary suddenly turns up dead, poisoned by a salmon sandwich, Elinor's dislike of Mary makes her the obvious suspect and hardly has time to take in what has happened before she finds herself on trial and condemned for murder. The only person who is not entirely convinced of Elinor's guilt is Doctor Peter Lord, who decides to contact his old friend Hercule Poirot in order to help him prove her innocence. Hercule Poirot finds himself trying to solve the mystery of the Cloade family. Rosaleen is the young widow of Gordon Cloade who was killed in a gas explosion in his London home. Rosaleen has inherited her late husband's substantial fortune and she and her brother David Hunter are refusing to share it with other members of Gordon Cloade's family. There have been persistent rumors that Rosaleen's first husband, an intrepid explorer, is still alive and as such would nullify her marriage to Gordon. What Poirot learns however is of a far greater deception that will alter everyone's perception of what they believe to their reality. Hastings returns to Britain after a long absence to find Poirot anxious for a new case which will challenge his gray cells. Poirot quickly gets his wish in the form of taunting letters from a serial killer who has dubbed himself ABC and who leaves an ABC railroad schedule at the scene of each crime. The victims as well as the crime scenes appear to be chosen randomly, but maintain an obsessive adherence to alphabetical order. However, Poirot grows to believe that the killer is not the madman the authorities believe, but a methodical murderer with a very tangible motive. Mr. Waverly, a man whose wealth belongs to his rich wife, comes to engage Poirot's services. He has had a letter telling him that his little son Johnnie will be kidnapped for ransom. Although Poirot is present at the Waverly home, the kidnapping goes ahead but all is not as it first seems. Poirot finds himself working on two cases, the first of which is more of an amusement, or so it seems. After meeting a delightful young couple, Stella and James Robinson, at a party he sets out to prove to Captain Hastings that there must be a reason for their good fortune in getting a lovely flat at a ridiculously low price. He is also brought into a more formal investigation by Inspector Japp who is hosting a loud-mouthed American FBI Agent who is on the trail of thieves who have made away with secret US Naval plans for a new submarine. The American isn't too impressed that Scotland Yard have brought in a private detective or that Japp has taken away his gun. When Poirot sees the man the FBI is trailing, he also realizes it's the same man who he has seen lurking outside the Robinsons apartment block. Poirot is approached by a Mrs. Todd, whose cook, Eliza Dunn, has suddenly disappeared. Poirot manages to track down the cook , and she tells him that a stranger, acting for a law firm, told her that she had inherited a property in the North of England but she had to go there immediately. Her heavy trunk was called for but it was deposited at the train station, where Poirot makes an interesting discovery, connected to a recent bank robbery. Hercule Poirot is called upon to solve a series of mysterious deaths that are centered around the Valley of the Kings in Egypt. Sir John Willard died moments after he and a group of archaeologists entered an ancient tomb. The expedition's physician, Dr. Ames, concluded it was a heart attack but soon other members begin to die in mysterious circumstances. One dies of blood poisoning from a relatively mild cut while another dies of tetanus. One member who has returned to New York has taken his own life. Rumors are soon circulating that an Egyptian curse is felling all those who desecrated the ancient tomb. Poirot and Captain Hastings set off for Egypt to determine what is happening and who might be behind it. Poirot and his friend Captain Hastings find themselves investigating the murder of Count Foscatini, who was found in his flat. As it turns out, the dead man's valet, Mr. Graves, has been dating Miss Lemon and has been less than honest with her about his profession. As for the dead nobleman, the police believe he was being blackmailed. The Italian Embassy denies any knowledge of the man and denies that he had any official role in the country. Poirot doubts the veracity of their claims but also concludes that others are lying as well. Poirot is thrilled to receive an invitation from renowned Belgian actress Marie Marvelle. She has been receiving anonymous notes about the Western Star, a valuable diamond purchased by her husband at a cut-rate price several years before. The notes speak to the mystical nature of the diamonds and that they should be returned to their rightful owners. The next day, Lady Yardly claims to have received similar notes about her own fabulous diamond, the Eastern Star. When Poirot and Hastings visit Lord and Lady Yardly the diamond is stolen in a daring robbery. Needless to say, none of this sits well with Poirot who finds he has a very tight knot to untie. Poirot attends the Victory Ball, a costume party where you are expected to dress as someone famous, as himself. However, when two members of a party of six dressed as characters from classical Italian comedy are subsequently found dead, Poirot finds himself working with Chief Inspector Japp to solve the case. The solution to the deaths of Viscount Cronshaw and Coco Courtney is to be found in determining the correct time of death and identifying an impostor at the ball. Poirot takes to the airwaves and reveals the identity of the killer on a live BBC radio broadcast. A Russian grand master dies mysteriously during an international chess match. The case is related to a political intrigue involving the so-called Peace Party and its leaders Madame Olivier and Abe Ryland. Poirot investigates with his old friends Hastings, Japp and lemon, helped by a reporter and a minor actress, but the quartet must soon fight a dangerous battle with the Big Four, a secret society manipulating for their own personal chess game a great number of international celebrities. In 1926, rich but childless Andrew Marsh writes a will providing generous bequests to friends, associates, and their children while leaving the bulk of his estate to a medical foundation. He conspicuously omits his young ward Violet Wilson on the chauvinistic grounds that girls will be provided for by their husbands. Marsh's sexist attitudes change over the years as Violet grows into a lovely, independent young woman and publisher of a feminist magazine. He announces that he is going to alter his will and leave 100% of the estate to his ward. On the same night he confides to Poirot that he is terminally ill and wants the detective to be executor of his estate, he is lured out of the house and murdered before he can write the new document. When his lawyer discovers that the old will has been stolen too, the dead man is declared intestate. While the local authorities attribute the death to natural causes, Poirot is given reason to believe that Marsh has an illegitimate son, the identity of whom will lead him to the murderer. Accompanying Inspector Japp to Brussels, who is receiving an award from the Belgian government, Hercule Poirot tells him a case from 20 years before. Poirot was a young policeman at the time and at the request of Virginie Mesnard, agrees to investigate the death of rising young politician, Paul Deroulard. The courts had already ruled that he had died of a heart attack, but she believes he was murdered. Poirot believed Deroulard had been poisoned, likely from a box of chocolates he had been given by an aristocrat, Xavier St. Alard. In the end, Poirot identified the killer, even obtaining a confession, but chose not to make it public, for reasons that he explains to his colleagues. Investigating a spy-ring, Lt. Colin Race comes to Wilbraham Crescent, where he literally bumps into agency typist Sheila Webb, as she comes flying out of number 19, the home of blind receptionist Millicent Pebmarsh. Sheila has discovered the body of a man whose identity proves hard to confirm, surrounded by four clocks, stopped at the same time. Miss Pebmarsh does not know the man and did not ask for the services of Sheila, who is the initial chief suspect. However, as Poirot is brought in to assist Inspector Hardcastle in the case, and the murderer strikes again, Poirot comes to realize that the man was killed elsewhere and brought to Miss Pebmarsh's house. The neighbors claim to have seen nothing but Poirot believes one of them may have had a secret which was worth killing for and sets out to unmask them, as well as explaining the significance, if any, of the clocks. At the same time, Colin solves his investigation with Poirot's help. Poirot and Captain Hastings travel to Cornwall at the request of Mrs. Pengelly but arrive to find that the woman is dead. She had told Poirot the previous day that she feared her dentist husband, Edward Pengelly, had been having an affair with his pretty receptionist and that further, he was trying to poison her. Apart from her husband, she has a niece and her fiancï¿½, but no other relatives in the village. When Inspector Japp arrests the husband for murder, the Belgian detective is convinced that the wrong person is in the dock. Banker Mr. Davenheim steps out of his house, into the fog, and disappears. Where has he gone? Poirot bets good friend inspector Japp five pounds that he can solve the mystery within the week, without leaving his flat, using Captain Hastings to collect the clues. Chief Inspector Japp, afraid that he will soon find himself unemployed, needs Poirot's assistance in solving a string of jewel robberies. Japp is under intense pressure to catch the thief but Poirot counsels patience. When the jewel thief strikes again, Poirot and Captain Hastings go to the home of Marcus Hardman, a jewelry collector from whom an emerald necklace was stolen. Poirot is apparently quite taken with the exiled Russian Countess Vera Rossakoff and to Japp's great consternation, days pass with no progress in the case. With the famous detective otherwise occupied, Hastings and Miss Lemon decide to investigate on their own. Poirot however knows well who the criminal is. Hercule Poirot is puzzled when Benedict Farley summons him to a late night meeting. Farley is known as the king of pies as his company manufactures a well-known brand of meat pies. At their meeting, he tells Poirot of a recurring dream where he takes a gun from his desk drawer, walks to his office window and commits suicide. His only question for Poirot is whether someone could be manipulating him psychologically. When Farley is found dead the next day - in circumstances that appear to match those in his dream - Poirot and Captain Hastings find themselves assisting Inspector Japp in a case that involves false identities and an affair. It is Miss Lemon, however, who provides Poirot with the vital information that allows him to solve the case While spending the weekend at his cottage outside London, Hercule Poirot is invited to dinner by Sir Henry and Lady Angkatell. Leaving immediately after dinner, he returns the next day to find that a weekend guest, John Christo, has been shot dead. There is any number of suspects: his former lover, Veronica Cray whom he had not seen for 12 years but suddenly turned up at a nearby cottage; his wife, Gerda who was deeply hurt by his womanizing; his current mistress Henrietta Savernake; Midge Hardcastle, who was very much in love with him, but whom he constantly ignored; and Edward Angkatell, who was in love with Midge. What Poirot finds however is that the evidence equally implicates everyone just a little too equally for it all to be just by chance. Tommy Mayfield is a British industrialist who has developed a new fighter plane. Up to now he has paid all development costs himself and he very much wants the government to contribute. It is reluctant to do so because of an apparent indiscretion some years before when Mayfield was supposed to have sold heavy artillery to the Japanese. In order to get back into the government's good books, he decides to lay a trap for Mrs. Vanderlyn, a known Nazi sympathizer and possible spy. The bait is the plans for the new fighter but Mayfield's wife is so concerned that she asks Hercule Poirot to spend the weekend at their house to make sure Vanderlyn doesn't get away with anything. En route to the train station to attend a disarmament conference in Paris, the Prime Minister's car is attacked by what the press describe as ruffians. The PM is slightly injured and does make it across the Channel to French soil, but never arrives in Paris. Poirot is called in by senior government officials as it appears the Prime Minister has been kidnapped. He soon comes to the conclusion however that the evidence from the first attack doesn't quite add up and all is not what it seems. After a visit to Parade film studios with his friend Captain Hastings, Poirot finds himself investigating the murder of Henry Reedburn, the head of the studio. Reedburn was something of a tyrant who had fired a veteran actor, taken over a major film from a young director and had recently blackmailed actress Valerie Saintclair into signing a new contract. Upon finding the body, Saintclair ran to a neighboring house to seek help, interrupting the Oglander family's bridge game in the process. However, the lack of a king of clubs on the card table provides Poirot with only clue he needs to solve the crime. In an attempt to snare the enigmatic art thief Marrascaud, Poirot and the Metropolitan Police set an irresistible trap: at the society debut of wealthy aristocrat Lucinda Le Mesurier, a priceless painting called 'Hercules Vanquishing the Hydra' by Marrascaud's favorite artist will be displayed, with Lucinda wearing exquisite diamond jewelery. A confident Poirot is convinced the criminal will be apprehended, but he does not foresee the eventual, disastrous outcome: not only does Marrascaud pinch the painting, but Lucinda herself is brutally murdered, and her jewels are stolen as well. The catastrophe weights heavily on Poirot's conscience, and he sinks into a steady depression, despite the entreaties of his physician, Dr Burton. Three months after Lucinda's murder, a lonely chauffeur asks Poirot to find his true love, the maid of celebrated Russian ballerina Katrina Samoushenka. Pitying the man, Poirot agrees to reunite the lovers pro bono and sets off to the Hotel Olympos in Rochers Neiges, Switzerland, where Katrina is supposedly staying. Run by the hearty (yet corrupt) Italian Francesco, the hotel is world-famous for its Alpine spa treatments, and much to Poirot's surprise, it is also Marrascaud's current hideout. But what identity has the villain taken? Among the guests, Poirot not only finds the bedridden Katrina, but also her imperious Austrian psychotherapist Dr Lutz, M.P. Harold Waring, who has shouldered the blame for an illicit scandal involving his superior, bossy Mrs Rice and her daughter Elsie Clayton, whose abusive husband is also staying at the hotel, parlor-game enthusiast Schwartz, and the only woman who has ever stirred his heart: former jewel thief Countess Vera Rossakoff, whose criminologist daughter Alice Cunningham is also present, along with her unsightly pet bulldog, Binky. A motley crew, indeed, and just as impenetrable. When an avalanche strands the guests, it becomes even more imperative to find Marrascaud. But several distractions prevent Poirot from facing his nemesis. Why is Katrina being deliberately evasive about the fate of her maid? Why does Dr Lutz have such a powerful hold on her? Why does Elsie's husband always dine in his room? What is Countess Rossakoff doing in Switzerland, and has she really given up her life of thievery? Why is Schwartz so hard to read? What happened to the old servant, Robert, and why is his replacement so inexperienced? Who tried to frighten Alice? As more and more questions pile up, less and less time remains as Poirot strives towards redemption for his past mistakes. But will he succeed in battling his inner demons as Hercules succeeded in conquering his twelve Labours, or will Marrascaud be the first criminal to prevail against the Belgian detective? Hercule Poirot is hired by Lord Pearson, who happens to be the head of the bank where Poirot keeps his accounts, to find Mr. Wu Ling who was to have attended a meeting at the bank that morning, but who has disappeared. The missing man was to sell the bank a deed to a silver mine. When the man is found dead, Poirot finds himself searching for a killer. All of the evidence seems to point to an American, Charles Lester, but Poirot finds that to be just a little too convenient. At home, Poirot and Captain Hastings find themselves involved in a vicious game of Monopoly! London & Scottish bank officer Mr. Shaw is scheduled to ride the maiden voyage of the Queen Mary to transfer $1 million in Liberty Bonds to the banks branch in America. But when Mr. Shaw is first almost run down in the street, and then poisoned, the assistant bank manager must take the bonds instead. The bank hires Poirot to accompany the bonds, so he and Mr. Hastings are able to ride the maiden voyage of the Queen Mary, much to Hastings delight. But when the bonds are stolen, suspicion falls on the assistant manager who has a history of large gambling debts. Living quietly in the small village of King's Abbot, sleuth Hercule Poirot becomes involved in the murder of successful industrialist Roger Ackroyd. The number of potential killers is almost as great as the population of the village itself. As Poirot investigates he sees that there might be a connection to the suicide of a local woman, and the death the previous year of her husband. Recovering from the horrors of World War I, British Army officer Arthur Hastings hopes to find peace and quiet at a country manor in the English countryside. But when the matriarch dies during the night from strychnine poisoning, Hastings enlists the help of an old friend staying nearby with other war refugees to help solve the murder: former Belgian police detective Hercule Poirot. Hercule Poirot accompanies his friend Captain Hastings on a weekend shooting party at the home of Harrington Pace, but he isn't having a very good time. He comes down with the flu and takes to his bed but when Pace is shot dead in his study, he rises to the occasion to assist Inspector Japp in solving the case. Pace was not very likable and treated those around him badly. He refused to acknowledge his illegitimate half brother, who worked on the family estate as the gamekeeper, refusing him even a small loan that would allow him to marry. His two nephews did not benefit from the family wealth having been told they may inherit something on this death. The solution to the case lies in correctly identifying the mysterious housekeeper, Mrs. Middleton, whom Pace had hired for a month and determining her exact role in this mysterious affair. After traveling on the Blue Train from Calais to Nice, Hercule Poirot is pressed into service to help solve the murder of heiress Ruth Kettering who is found savagely beaten in her compartment. She was the daughter of wealthy industrialist Rufus Van Alden and very much wanted a divorce. Both her husband and her lover were on the train but she had changed rooms with another passenger, Katherine Grey, so the question naturally arises as to whether she was the intended victim. Grey may also have had enemies as she had recently inherited a very large sum of money and greedy relatives had suddenly taken a interest in her. When an attempt is subsequently made on Grey's life, this appears to the case but Poirot methodically sifts through all of the clues to determine the motive and identify the killer. Lady Chatterton asks for Poirot's assistance when she comes to fear for the safety of her friend, Marguerite Clayton. Specifically, she is convinced that Marguerite's husband Edward Clayton, known for his violent temper, will kill her. Poirot is invited to a party in order to meet Clayton, but he never shows up. The next day, Poirot finds himself being interviewed by Inspector Japp when Edward Clayton's body is found hidden in an elaborate Spanish chest located in the same room as the party the previous evening. When Marguerite's friend Major Rich is arrested for the murder, Poirot correctly deduces the true nature of the crime and the identity of the culprit. Poirot investigates the murder of Florence Carrington while traveling on the express train to Plymouth. Her father, mining entrepreneur Gordon Halliday, will spare no expense to have the crime solved. She had recently been approached by her estranged husband Rupert, asking for money and was seen having lunch with a one-time suitor, Armand de la Rochefort, of whom her father disapproves. However, the victim's jewelry was stolen and Poirot realizes that to find the murderer, they must first find the jewels. When Prince Farouq of Egypt foolishly lets a tart wear a fabulously valuable royal ruby, she simply walks away with it. With Hastings away in Scotland for the Christmas holidays, Poirot finds himself spending Christmas with the Lacey family. Colonel Lacey, a well-known Egyptologist, was one of the few people who knew the ruby was in England. As Poirot investigates, he learns that the Colonel is having financial difficulties and also that one of the house guests, Desmond Lee-Wortley, may not be of the soundest character. With the help of the children in the household, Poirot sets a trap for the thief. Hercule Poirot is bored to tears and with three weeks since his last case, is worried that his little gray cells will stop working. Captain Hastings suggest a evening at the theater to see the latest murder mystery but even that doesn't help when Poirot finds the plot to be absurd. On their return home to Whitehaven Mansions, they learn that the new occupant of the flat two floors below Poirot's has been found shot. She had only moved in that very same day and was an unknown. Poirot puts his little gray cells to good use and assists Inspector Japp of Scotland Yard in identifying the murderer. Having been lured to the village of Marsdon Leigh under false pretenses - the local hotel owner is unable to solve the crime in his own manuscript and so invites the detective to solve a "murder" - Poirot and Hastings are asked to look into the death of Mr. Maltravers, owner of the local manor house. The local rumor mill has it that the Marsdon Manor is haunted by several ghosts and Maltravers' wife is convinced that her husband was frightened to death. In the end, Poirot initiates a clever ruse to obtain a confession from the murderer. Reuben Astwell is an evil man. He is hated by his nephew, his wife, his employees, his brother, his female assistant, and Poirot himself after he meets the man. So when Astwell is found dead shortly after Poirot visits to have dinner with Astwell and view the man's collection of Belgian miniatures, Poirot has many suspects from which to choose. Poirot despairs at the lack of crime - and work - concluding that he, Hercule Poirot, has scared off the criminal classes. His mood brightens when Lady Millicent Castle-Vaughn - the veiled Lady of the title - asks him to recover from her blackmailer some indiscreet letters written in her youth. Unable to convince the man to reduce the amount asked for, Poirot decides to take matters into his own hands and steal them. As Poirot and Hastings learn however, not all is as it seems, starting with Lady Millicent. Hercule Poirot has a rare opportunity when he gets a second chance to solve a murder circumstance prevented him from solving two years before. On his way to visit Capt. Hastings in the Argentine, Poirot had stopped in Buenos Aires. While out for dinner, a young woman named Iris Russell was poisoned. The police found cyanide in her purse and ruled her death to be suicide, something her husband Barton Russell refuses to accept. When Poirot agrees with him and raises objections to the hasty police verdict, he is quickly ordered deported. Now, two years later, Russell Barton is hosting a dinner in London on the anniversary of his wife's death with everyone who was present invited to the event. This time, Poirot has no intention of letting the killer get away. Poirot is visited by a distraught girl, Norma Restarick, who fears she may have killed someone but runs away, telling him that he's too old rather than explaining further. By coincidence, Poirot's friend Ariadne Oliver lives in the same apartment block as Norma and her two roommates and recently went to their party, where Norma was distressed when she was offered ice cream. Norma's ex-nanny, Miss Lavinia Seagram, an alcoholic, also lived in the block but was recently found dead, with the verdict being suicide. Ariadne is unconvinced and searches the nanny's apartment, finding a clue which she puts in her handbag. Soon afterward she is attacked and the bag and its contents are stolen. Poirot visits the Restarick family home in the country, owned by Norma's great-uncle, Sir Roderick, an elderly and half-blind man who is dependent upon Sonia, his young personal assistant (who may well be a gold-digger). Andrew Restarick, Norma's father, explains to Poirot that he spent much of Norma's childhood working abroad, leaving her with her unstable mother and Nanny Seagram. Norma admits to Poirot that she blames herself for her mother's suicide, which took place when the little girl was on an outing with the nanny and wanted to stop for an ice cream. She now believes that if she had got home earlier she would have saved her mother, hence her revulsion at being offered ice cream. Poirot and Ariadne visit Miss Battersby, Norma's former school teacher, where they discover something very suspicious about Norma's friends and family. Also convinced that Miss Seagram's death was not suicide, Poirot enlists Norma's help in setting a trap to catch whoever killed her old nanny and is now trying to frame her. The inoffensive Reverend Babbington chokes to death at a cocktail party he is attending with his wife at the home of famous actor Sir Charles Cartwright. Some time later Sir Bartholomew Strange, an eminent doctor and friend of Cartwright, also dies of poisoning at a dinner party he is giving miles away. There appears to be no link between the two deaths but Poirot, assisted by Cartwright, offers to help Superintendent Crossfield in the investigation and discovers that a mysterious butler with a birthmark on his wrist was hired for the night and appeared to share a joke with the dead doctor. This man has now vanished and would seem to the killer. A third death, that of a sanatorium patient who has written to Poirot, would appear to link to the doctor's murder and there is certainly a secret which somebody will go to any lengths to conceal - but who would gain from the death of a harmless old vicar? Just as his holiday on the island of Rhodes is coming to an end, Hercule Poirot finds himself investigating a murder when one of the hotel guests, Valentine Chantry, is poisoned in the bar. The drink she had was apparently meant for her husband and had been bought by Douglas Gold, with whom she had been carrying on since her arrival. Gold is arrested and everyone assumes he is the perpetrator but Poirot thinks otherwise however and looks to the other guests in the hotel as more likely suspects. When a local pathologist confirms that the poison used was local in origin, Poirot realizes that only when he learns who purchased the poison will he learn the killer's identity. At a village fï¿½te, Poirot runs into an old friend, John Harrison and his fiancï¿½ Molly Deane, a fashion model. Harrison invites Poirot and Hastings to tea the following week where Poirot learns that Molly had once been engaged to a local artist, Claude Langton. Poirot is puzzled by a number of apparently unrelated incidents but concludes that someone is being untruthful and that a murder is being planned. Courtesy of Hastings' new hobby, photography, Poirot knows exactly what is going to occur. Insp. Japp is hospitalized with a case of appendicitis. Ian Hislop examines the work of Victorian "do-gooders" - campaigners who were responsible for bringing about social reform in Britain, abolishing injustices such as slavery and young children working in coal mines and mills, and for raising the age of consent. "The Agency for All & Everything" is run and founded by Spiridon Don Karamarkovic, an ex-soldier of French Foreign Legion. He has contacts within all structures, answers for any questions, but he's also the biggest stingy of all bosses in the world. The agency has a lot of various clients whose problems come up and solve from one episode to another. After the Battle of New York, the world has changed. It now knows not only about the Avengers, but also the powerful menaces that require those superheroes and more to face them. In response, Phil Coulson of the Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division assembles an elite covert team to find and deal with these threats wherever they are found. With a world rapidly becoming more bizarre and dangerous than ever before as the supervillains arise, these agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. are ready to take them on. Skye is now integrated into Coulson's team as a consultant. Their next assignment is in Peru, tracking a "0-8-4", a S.H.I.E.L.D. prefix for "an object of unknown origin". Once there, the team quickly realizes that the object is actually a piece of forgotten HYDRA technology powered by Tesseract energy. Coulson meets with a former ally, Camilla Reyes and brings her onboard the team plane. Later, Reyes betrays Coulson and plans to take the HYDRA weapon for herself so she can take over Peru. The squabbling team members band together, utilizing each of their talents, and save the day. Skye receives a text message from another member of the Rising Tide and confirms her allegiance to them. Afterwards, Director Nick Fury scolds Coulson for the damage to the plane, and warns him about the risk Skye poses. While on a mission to learn more about the secrets of the mysterious writing, Coulson finds himself attacked by the only person he can trust: Agent Melinda May. Meanwhile, the rest of the team is trapped in an explosive situation, and it's up to Fitz to save them - but is he up to it? Hunted and running out of solutions, Coulson puts his team right in the line of fire in the hopes of saving them all. But with General Talbot, Hydra and Creel all on the attack, can they possibly survive? Meanwhile, a mysterious Doctor harbors some dangerous secrets that could destroy one of our core team members. Coulson and his team are now wanted fugitives with limited resources - but that's not stopping them from keeping the world safe from powerful and unseen threats everywhere. However, with new members they hardly know, will S.H.I.E.L.D. ever be trusted again? In the wake of re-surfacing of Centipede, Shield recruits Mike after their last not-so-warm encounter, in order to balance the scales against Centipede's super-soldiers. At this end Centipede is looking for technology which would allow them to stabilize the serum fully. Amidst all these is the myth of a Clairvoyant and Shield has never been at such a downside of advantage at discerning the true intentions of their opponents. Coulson and his team arrive at a base called the S.H.I.E.L.D Hub and are given an assignment by it's director Agent Victoria Hand. The assignment calls for Ward and Fitz to head to South Ossetia and disable a weapon device called the Overkill. Skye and Simmons try to find out more information about the mission, since they are not privy to details about the mission which has been classified as Level 8. Simmons manages to tranquilize Agent Jasper Sitwell who catches her in the act of hacking into top secret Level 8 files. Skye deduces from the information that there is no extraction team coming to pick up Ward and Fitz as Coulson learns about this upon catching her. After a talk with Victoria Hand, Coulson and the team proceed to rescue Ward and Fitz (who manage to disable the Overkill device) as S.H.I.E.L.D. Agents move in on the compound. Coulson did find out that the person who brought Skye to the orphanage when she was young was an as-yet-unidentified S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent. In the final scene, Coulson (wanting to find out about his recuperation in Tahiti) is denied access to the Level 8 information despite his high level S.H.I.E.L.D. clearance as the person he calls up about it asks if he would like to get approval from Nick Fury about it. Coulson declines and hangs up. A priest falls in love with a young artist. Their secret affair is revealed and the Media try to destroy both of them. Apart from their affair, the dirty past of the priest is discovered by a reporter. Nothing can stop them from being together. Or maybe someone can...

null 20 half-hour episodes. Jane Lucas, an Agony Aunt with a call-in radio show, has her own set of troubles with her very Jewish mother and her husband Laurence. Then there's the crazy lives of her station co-workers and the nice gay couple who live upstairs. "Agony" dealt with viewers problems. Some wonderful examples were "I can't have sex unless the family dog is in the room" and "I'm Stuffing the Turkey, He's Stuffing the Neighbour". The show was made by low budget TV station L!VE TV. Each "letter" (usually made up in a rush by some poor L!VE hack) would be dramatised and then discussed by the studio presenter and two agony aunts. The show also used bubble thoughts, an on-screen device to reveal what the character was actually thinking, although normally it was just a way to get away with crude jokes about sausages and "you came quickly". A damn good way to waste a half hour. The show origins were with a show titled Martin Agronsky: Evening Edition on a local PBS affiliate in Washington, WETA, in 1971 The re-titled showed went national in 1976 on PBS affiliates and syndicated by the shows producer, the Post-Newsweek company. The host Martin Agronsky was a distinguished journalist who gained national prominence as the host of the long running CBS interview show "Face the Nation". At the time, Face the Nation used the dominant format for the network Sunday morning interview shows. Similar to a press conference, a prominent figure in politics or the news would be interviewed by a panel of reporters and journalists. Each panelist would ask their questions in turn, with no interaction with each other. In contrast, the Agronsky show popularized the "Journalist Round Table Discussion" format used by other more well more known shows, such as the McLaughlin Group and PPS's Washington Week in Review. Each week, a group of noted journalists engaged in a free wheeling discussion on a wide range of hot button issues moderated by Agronsky. Many other news show, notably ABC's This Week David Brinkley began incorporating the format into segments of the show. Agronsky & Co is most often compared to the McLaughlin Group. However, the style of the hosts could not be more different. Where Martin Agronsky was a calming influence on the sometimes heated discussions, John McGlaughlin is known to raise the decibel levels and stir things up. Several of the Agronksy regulars moved on to those shows, most notably columnist and author George Will. Other prominent regulars on the show included Time Magazine editor Hugh Sidey and journalists Elizabeth Drew, Carl Rowan and James J. Kilpratrick. Kilpatrick gained fame in the 1970s for his contentious commentary in 60 minutes "Point-Counter Point" segment". Rowan was a pioneering black journalist. Although tame by today's standard, the contentious exchanges between the very conservative and Kilpatrick and very liberal Rowen foreshadowed a style of discussion that some call "food fight" TV. With Agronsky & Co., Drew and Will provided more calmed reasoning from the left and right, with Sidey appearing to be the quintessential moderate. After the show ended in 1987, several of the cast members, including Drew and Sidey participated in a show distributed by the same producer that could be considered a successor series. However, it never gained the prominence of the ground breaking Agronsky & Co. Martin Agronsky passed away in 1999. Elisa and her children, Paola, Daniel and Anita fall victim to the conspiracies of Elisa's overbearing mother-in-law as she plots, together with her powerful lawyer friend, Julian Ledezma to have them disinherited.

"Ain't Misbehavin'" is a delightful wartime comedy about two very different bandsmen (Eddie and Eric) and their misadventures with gangsters, romance, and black-marketing in Blitz-time London. Rio and his buddy Wiley are supposedly just ordinary pilots working for the Latin American air transport company Air America. In truth, they are undercover secret agents receiving their orders directly from the State Department in Washington. As part of their duties they investigate international crime, protect witnesses, rescue people who need rescuing, and occasionally get themselves out of messes that their boss, Furman, keeps getting them into as he tries to line his own pockets. Australia's airline history is a saga of daring feats, can-do attitude, pig-headed visionaries, iron-fisted politicians, warring pilots; of humble beginnings and mega deals. The story begins in World War One with the death-defying exploits of four bold young airmen-Norman Brearley, Charles Kingsford Smith, Wilmot Hudson Fysh and Paul McGinness-who would go on to establish Australia's first airlines. Encouraged by Prime Minister Billy Hughes, they were among the brave and stubborn men responsible for conquering the tyranny of distance, within our vast continent and between it and Europe. They faced difficult, often dangerous conditions-marred at the start by accidents and fatalities, but highlighted by ground-breaking, headline-grabbing flights. Behind the scenes, however, battles were fought in boardrooms and with backers and bureaucrats to keep the airlines aloft. Gradually, businessmen replaced aviators at the helm of the companies, and take-overs rather than take-offs became front-page news. In an era of corporate giants like Sir Reginald Ansett, Sir Peter Abeles, Robert Holmes a Court and Rupert Murdoch, the stakes climbed even higher... Air Australia revisits this grand but turbulent history. It called the Garmin 1000, Diamond aircraft in London Ontario has pioneered it. A new kind of glass cockpit for private pilots. It looks like an Airbus 320 inside, two screens, and an incredible amount of information. G1000 is a revolution in flying that will change the way bush pilots fly up north. Computers, plot positions on maps, calculate fuel burn. Hundreds of pilots have lost their lives getting lost, the G1000 should put an end to that. We see G1000 at work in the Lancair4p the highest flying pressurized kit plane in the world. It flies at 340 miles per hour, and flies at 43000 feet. It is pressurized through a unique new system. We ask why an aircraft needs to be pressurized, we travel to Simon Fraser university to interview Andrew Blaber, a scientist who studies the effects of low oxygen on the human body. He shows us Canada's most powerful hyperbaric chamber, capable of producing conditions found at 100 thousand feet. Blaber has learned that we can monitor a person's eye balls, for signs of hypoxia (lack of oxygen at altitude). It is a break through in aero medical research that has NASA now using Blabers work. Expert: Andrew Blaber: Canadian Two Russians and Two Canadians, Bud Granley and His son Ross are two generations of Canadian forces pilots. Both were Snowbirds (Bud's other son was also a Snowbird). Today Bud and Ross fly Russian airplanes at air shows across Canada. The Yak 18 is the Russian version of the Canadian Beaver a Siberian Bush plane. The airplane is very very different from anything in North America, different builders, same needs... different approaches. We compare the two planes. And learn Canadians and Russians share a remote north and love of super strong airplanes. Bud is considered the top vintage plane pilot in North America. He flies a Harvard (a CDN trainer) painted up in early Canadian forces colors. This is big round engined airplane... old, loud and dependable. It is a labour of love keeping these planes in the air. We learn what it takes to keep history flying. We learn what it takes to fly high performance bush Aircraft, Experts: Bud Granley, Canadian, Ross Granley, Canadian. Go Fast: We head for CFB Cold Lake, where Capt. Reichert works. This is AETE the Air Force test establishment. If it is cutting edge the military tests it here first. We learn about the latest upgrades that will make the CF 18 Hornet a 21 first century aircraft. We learn about the new ejection seat system developed at Cold Lake. The show follows two CF-18 traveling at the speed of sound. We learn that many pilots were killed as super sonic flight was developing because the airplane changes, as it passes through the sound barrier. It took pilots and engineers years to solve the problem... the air craft becomes nose heavy, and tends to want to dive towards the ground. The Hornet, had to be designed to take this into account. The show will explain what shock waves are and why they are produced. We will show viewers where Canadian pilots (and all Nato pilots) train super sonic in Northern Alberta,. the "SONIC CORRIDOR". The fastest 1000 miles of forest in the world. Experts: Lcol Paul Kissman: Canadian Major Mike Barker: Canadian. We arrive at the War Plane museum in Hamilton to fly the Lancaster bomber. One of only two left flying the world. There we the most important planes flown by the allies during the European part of the war. The airplane is called the Mynarski (check spelling ) named after a young Canadian aviator who sacrificed his life in Lancaster saving the rest of his crew over Europe. (use historical photos) We also learn about the Mitchell B 25 bomber the airplane used in the Pacific theatre by the Allies. Both were critical airplanes... both operated very very differently. We learn about their history, their short coming, and their engineering. Dave Rohr (a former Canadian forces pilot) is our expert and pilot who takes us flying. He demonstrates the technology of the day and what makes the planes special. He gives Mark and Reichert a chance to fly in a bit of Canadian war history. Experts Dave Rohr: Canadian. Tail Draggers every Canadian forces pilot who flew in WW2 learned how to fly a two seater "tail dragger". Today only a handful of the WW2 aircraft exist. many were built in Toronto, we find one of the old planes and learn what made it fly. Capt. Reichert invites his old instructor Kent Peich to join us. Kent restores, builds and flies tail draggers, He is also a retired military pilot and now a commercial pilot. Kent is one of the best airshow pilots in Canada because of his skill in the tail dragger. Kent teaches us that the planes were made of fabric to keep them light. They were tail draggers, (a single wheel in the back) because it made the airplanes simple to build and maintain, important during war time. The trade off was it made the airplanes very difficult to land and take off. "Ground Loops" killed many many pilots, We learn what causes a ground loop, and learn how young pilots were taught to avoid them. We learn from Kent that the Interstate Cadet was one of the first airplanes shot down in World War 2. (historic photos) We watch Kent fly in an airshow, and learn the engineering tricks he uses to keep the tired old airplane in the air. The show ends with Capt. Reichert flying in the airshow with Kent and landing the airplane on an RV demonstrating Reichert and Kent's skill and precision. Kent Peich: Canadian. We go to Moose Jaw Saskatchewan to learn about the physics of flying in formation. Ever military pilot in Canada and the (everywhere else) has had top learn to do this. It is challenging and dangerous. But is is also a necessary evil. Airplanes flying during war time didn't have very good instruments, so flying in bad weather meant flying off your buddies wing. Five airplanes together meant five brains. Many many pilots have died because they got disorientated in cloud. Formation helps to solve that. We learn about the basics of formation, and then we see it at it extreme. The Snowbirds are the only 9 plane formation team in North America.....considered the best in the world because of their precise formation skills. We ride alone in the CT 114 the airplane that trained more Canadian forces pilots than any thing else. This is a Canadian built airplane,... with enormous history. We learn about G forces, and travel to Toronto to see Reichert train in the government's Centrifuge, (a machine that artificially creates G forces). We learn that the team experiences G Forces that can top nine. We learn about how they manage those forces without passing out. Experts: Major Steve Will: Canadian Major Stu MacIntosh: Canadian. Maki's anger erupted into a violent rage when she saw Mina! After defeating several of the Black Alliance members, Maki is challenged to a fight by their leader, Kinjiro, who is also known as "Kin-chan." As Maki and Kinjiro prepare to battle drawing closer to each other, Nagato, another member from the Black Alliance, steps in gesturing that he want to be the next to fight the Air Master. Maki quickly accepts Nagato's challenge. Julietta, who was sitting nearby noticed Maki and proceeded to approach her, to his surprise, Nagato quickly lands a kick to Julietta's body. Before the final fight between Maki and Kinjiro can even start, a fierce battle between Nagato and Julietta takes place! Although the kidnapped Mina was rescued from the hands of the Black Alliance, Tsukio, Reiichi, and Shinnosuke are soon overwhelmed by the growing number of the Black Alliance. Tsukio realizes that they would soon be annihilated and orders Shinnosuke and Reiichi to flee from the scene carrying Mina. However, they are soon cornered by the growing number of Black Alliance members. At the same time, there is a man with a dignified look sitting in a caf?' calling out the leaders of the Black Alliance. He is the president of Black Alliance of Justice and Sincerity "Kinjiro Kitaeda," also known as "Kin-chan." In realizing what has done, Kinjiro becomes agitated and hit one of his members with all his might! And finally, Maki arrives to find Mina! At last, the fight of Black Alliance of Righteousness and Sincerity vs. Maki starts! "I will defeat you. I will become a perfect dazzling star in the night sky tonight!" declares Konishi. While standing up to Julietta's random power, Konishi keeps telling himself to remain cool. Konishi breaks Julietta's right leg with his left arm! You can hear the ligament snap in the quiet of the evening park! Konishi prepares for him to submit. However, for some reason, Julietta's right leg comes flying in! And faster than before! How can this be? His ligament was torn! In any case, this is true. Konishi, telling himself to stay cool even more than before, stops trying to guard Julietta's kicks and tries to tackle him instead. If he uses all five of his senses at once he'll tackle him and defeat him! While this is going on, Maki is practicing attacks blindfolded with Miori at their home. Maki learns to be able to sense her surroundings. And then, Maki learns to feel the air... Yuu, Michiru, Mina, Renge, and Maki went to Shibuya. When on the street, a young man named Shinnosuke Tokita whose goal was to beat the Air Master, presented his challenge. This man who challenged Maki carried a Sansetsukon, a deadly weapon that he had trained with since the age of five.Before the fight with Shinnosuke could commence, Kaori Sakiyama shows up unexpectedly to challenge Maki to the first fight. Kai is walking along a large road following the locator that Fukamichi gave to her. Slowly but surely, she approaches her opponent. Miori is alongside and her and is completely emotionally attacked to Kai. Her opponent happens to be Kinjiro Kitaeda, or Kin-chan! As soon as they realize who their opponent is, they start into a full-out battle! Izakaya Bomber vs. Chi Punch. Or more so, Sky Star Pro Wrestler vs. the Spirited Right Puncher!" They're in the middle of a busy street with cars and people around, plus it's broad daylight. A large gallery of people form to watch them find each other un affected by their surroundings. Though Kin-chan is looking for the Air Master, he cannot hide is surprise at her toughness. The tension between the two grows! Kinjiro tries to end it with his ultra-fast right while Kai is trying to show him her "way of life." The fight between these two is one for the ages! They're in a dead heat! Which one will win? After the pro wrestling event, everyone slowly starts to change. Shinnosuke makes a resolution in his heart and leaves on a solitary voyage. Maki, on the other hand, is rendered completely dumb after the match. She isn't giving off the same aura she had while in the ring! Dumbfounded by this, Kaori Sakiyama begins to preach to Maki and confesses that she was fired from her job. Kaori then drags Maki to work the same part-time job she took up. Her job is to play the villain in the High Rangers hero show at the amusement park. Maki is up there, dumb as ever, with a bunch of wannabe fighters on stage. Then, the enemy leader that Sakiyama is playing, Empress Cockroach, enters the stage! Sakiyama is a natural to play this role and the children are likewise truly frightened. She kicks Maki to the side as the show heats up. Maki seems to be wondering what the heck she is doing on stage and then she comes attacking out of nowhere! Now the real hero show will begin! A cosplaying man named Shigeo Komata, his clothes are ragged and he has a crew cut like someone out of a video game. Though he based his attacks on a video game character, his power is not to be taken lightly! For this reason, he is number six in the Fukamichi Ranking. Maki definitely sees that he's not someone who will be beaten if she doesn't give 100%. At the same time, Kinjiro Kitaeda is fighting the 10th ranked fighter upon Fukamichi's instructions. He's being swiftly punched by his nimble opponent, but he responds with "There's no soul in your punches" and knocks him out in one blow. Fukamichi watches this all happen and even sees Yashiki, the 8th ranked fighter who can use the osmosis attack, be quickly overcome. We have a new rival here, folks! Meanwhile, Maki is reluctantly going to have her rematch with Shigeo. She is thinking up a special attack to finally beat him while watching a movie with Mina. A move to beat an opponent in one split second... Maki has an idea! Maki is confronted by a man named Julietta Sakamoto who Tsukio knows and calls a strong man. Approaching Maki, he begins to whisper words of love into her ear and gently kisses her hand. Maki is quite surprised while her friends Yuu and Michiru drop their jaws at the sight of this. Renge uncontrollably eats a snack that was given to her by Julietta. And as for Mina, she blurts out "I am Maki's lover!"Maki and her companions are completely caught off guard by the actions of Julietta. And as for Maki who wants to fight Julietta, she knows to get involved further might be a dangerous risk of a different sort. Maki challenges Julietta to a fight. The appointed time is three o'clock and that's when she wakes up. "I overslept!" said Maki. However, the man who arrived at the appointed place on time was Maki's father, "Shiro Saeki". Without Maki's presence, Shiro challenges Julietta to a fight, but to Julietta, Shiro was not the one he was eagerly waiting for. Julietta begins to plant a sequence of kicks that were filled with fury. As Maki proceeds as quickly as possible to the appointed place, she is stopped on route and challenged to another fight by a girl named Miori Saeki. The girl is in fact Maki's half-sister who has a similar passion for battle. Maki, who is seriously in a hurry, arrives at the appointed place by quickly throwing off Miori. Miori then follow Maki to the appointed place to witness the unexpected defeat of their father. Finally, the full-out battle of Maki and Julietta begins! From the scene that took place the other day, several girls (also known as a ko-gal group) immediately began to voice their acceptance in having Maki join their circle of friends. The group include Yuu, Michiru, Mina, and Renge. Maki was nicknamed Maki-chan.The ko-gal group planned an outing to a pool where they could showoff some new and very revealing bathing suits. A few days later, each of them were modeling their new bathing suit. During the pool outing, a girl named Kaori Sakiyama also noticed the girl and became jealous, challenging the entire group to a swimming match. A few days after being completely defeated by the woman, Yuki Minaguchi, Kinjiro Kitaeda puts on a new Shizuna-man outfit dubbed Shizuna-man Version 2. But once Nagato saw him in that armor, the atmosphere suddenly changes. He doesn't seem like the normal, passionate Kin-chan... Wanting to test out Shizuna-man Version 2, Shizuna takes Kin-chan directly to a park that night. Kin-chan starts to realize his power, but somewhere in his heart he feels uneasy. But, he cannot conceal the greatness of the power he's received. But something is different... His opponent is Lucha Master, who is giving him all he's got in return. What happened to the fight he expected? A mysterious man calling himself Fukamichi suddenly appears in front of Tsukio and Reiichi asking them to join the Fukamichi Ranking. Tsukio is annoyed at his attitude but invites Lucha Master to take his place. Right when they think the fight is about to start, Fukamichi calls out the 36th ranked fighter in the Fukamichi Ranking and he defeats Lucha Master in one second. The three of them are disappointed and shocked by this. While this is going on, a man who says he is in the Fukamichi Ranking appears before Kai and Mio. This man is named Yashiki. He appears to want to fight the Air Master. He is ranked number nine and appears quite confident in his fighting abilities. Kai doesn't really understand what the Fukamichi Ranking is all about but she says to Yashiki that if he wants to fight the Air Master, he has to beat her first. Then Yashiki busts out an osmosis attack like Kaori Sakiyama's, and a strong one at that! Kai is knocked down in one blow! Miori is stunned by what is happening before her and she called out for her sister, Maki! The mysterious street fighting story of the Fukamichi Ranking is underway! "Win, Maki." Maki Aikawa tosses her body away during the fight and realizes the true essence of fighting. She thinks. She searches. That is why she's so strong when at full power. Her opponents all know this well. The people she encounters all experiences this and changed forever. She allows them to change. Kaori Sakiyama represents one such people. From meeting with Maki, a fire was lit inside her heart and her passion level rose. She was also the first friend that Maki, someone who has lived her life fighting every day, has ever known. She's no longer a lonely fighter. She has a friend who worries about her. Maki then thinks of all her friends, Yuu, Michiru, Renge, Mina... How they all cheer her on. Maki can fight full-on because she has friends in her corner. She'll continue to meet people, friends and enemies. People are able to grow and feel despair from the people they meet. But no matter what, she'll continue on. It's because she's continued on that she's made it to the place she's currently in. The person she encounters here is called an Eternal. She doesn't know if he's aiming for the top or not. Nevertheless, Maki flies through the air with all her power. She's the Air Master! Maki's strength is fully tested by the Fukamichi Ranking. Maki easily defeats the 17th ranked fighter but waiting at the side is a dangerous looking fighter, her opponent. He says "Welcome to the Sniper Karate course." There is also a man who has come to Tokyo after hearing of Maki's spectacular fights. The leader of the Ranking, Fukamichi himself, invited him and it's none other than Kinjiro Kitaeda. Instead of fighting a rematch with the Air Master he opts to join the Fukamichi Ranking. Nagato overhears Fukamichi say "Kinjiro Kitaeda, I want you," while recruiting him. Nagato says "What did you just say to Kin-chan?" Nagato is in a blind rage of jealousy due to those words. Fukamichi, who just came to recruit him, is unfazed and taunts Nagato. This doesn't look like it'll end smoothly! A group of high school students in their school uniforms came to Tokyo on a field trip. They call themselves the "Black Alliance of Justice and Sincerity". While the Black Alliance enjoy fighting, they also have aspiration of becoming Japan's number one fighting group. Immediately, they begin to challenge the students of the Tokyo area. To their surprise, the Tokyo students present little challenge and are defeated quite easily. Quickly gaining confidence, the Black Alliance begin to say that the people of Tokyo are weak. However, while still in Tokyo, the members of the Black Alliance noticed Mina Nakanotani, who is famous throughout Japan for having such a well-endowed figure. The members of Black Alliance are overjoyed and immediately start to dance wildly when seeing Mina in real life. Rudely, they push Mina's companion , Maki, out of the way for an opportunity to have a picture taken with her. At the end of the photo shoot, the Black Alliances suddenly abduct Mina and run away from the scene. Renge, another companion of Mina begins to panic at what had just happened and turns to their other friend Maki, to apprise her of the situation. Maki is nowhere to be found! Maki and Kai will have real Fukamichi Ranking battles. Fukamichi gives them both locators to find the other person, to be worn on their wrists. Though it's an incredible device to help you locate your opponent, Maki can't figure out how to work it at all! Fukamichi is amazed how dull she is besides for her fighting skills. Though she can't figure it out, she ends up in a dilapidated building. The locator shows her opponent is close by and then he shows up! His name is Koji Ogata. He's dressed oddly and his unusual movements confuse Maki. His attack style is Ninjutsu! Maki can't figure out his attacks and his being hit over and over. Fukamichi sees this and says, "For Maki Aikawa, it's only a matter of time." Like he's signaling the final blow, Ogata sends out this shrill whistle sound. Maki continues to be hit. Then, Ogata begins to look like multiple people! Is that possible?! Maki's in trouble! The man who appeared in front of Julietta was the younger brother of the ringleader of the Ranking's younger brother, Fukamichi. Nobuhiko challenges Julietta to a fight. He thought Julietta Sakamoto would be unable to fight and he mistakenly feels happy. Fukamichi watches the fight on the monitor excitedly, with bated breath. He then sees his brother get knocked out and his head stuck into the ceiling. The fight ended while he was still introducing himself. Then, Kinjiro, whose left arm was destroyed in the fight against Kai, stumbles into a clinic. He says crazy things to the doctor like, "please reset the bone now," and "just make it so I can throw five more punches." His requests ignored and being told to be admitted in the hospital, Kinjiro leaves in search of another doctor. Just then, he meets a girl nurse named Shizuna. She tells him to come with her because she can fix his arm and then leads him into a strange basement. Kin-chan feels like something strange is about to happen to him! Air Master vs. Sky Star, the mid-air battle extravaganza has finally begun! But Kai is a cut above Maki when it comes to the ring. Maki is about to collapse! But then, Sakiyama yells from ringside, "What the hell are you doing in there?!" But then Maki is smacked! Mio, Kai and the spectators are all stunned. Sakiyama is screaming to kick Kai and Mio's butts! Sakiyama goes to unleash her Hua Jing on Kai but it misfires. Then Kai and Mio explode in a magnificent combination attack! Sakiyama and Maki are knocked into their corner. Kai hits with her Missile Kick and Mio unleashes her special attack, the Izakaya Bomber, on the back of Maki's head. Mio and Kai sandwich her with an Izakaya Bomber. Mio taunts Maki, saying this is what pro wrestling is really like, but Sakiyama smirks back saying this is perfect for her. Hearing that, Kai decides to unleash an attack that employs her true spirit as a pro wrestler. The match is approaching its climax! Maki's involuntary encounter with Julietta Sakamoto left her confused. She spaces out and decided not to go to school because something still doesn't feel right. She wants the challenge of battle but knows it is not possible.Mina begins to worry about Maki who did not come to school and decides to visit her, even thought she does not know her address. Michiru, Yuu, Shinnosuke and the very strangely dressed Renge follow Mina. Renge casts a strange spell and impressively locates Maki. As they begin to approach Maki, she's walking through the rain without an umbrella while appearing to be gathered in deep thought they were unable to call to her.After leaving a letter for Julietta in his mailbox, Maki went to the gym of fighter named Shiro Saeki. It seems like there is a long history between Maki and Shiro. At the same time, Julietta, who had received the letter from Maki, was very excited about its contents. Kin-chan loses to Yuki Minaguchi. His right arm is back to full function but he's overwhelmed by Yuki's strength. Her next opponent is the Air Master. All the Fukamichi Ranking fans across the country have been awaiting this battle as the fight begins in earnest. Both Maki and Yuki try to end the fight with their special attack right at the start. But, they both notice the other's attack and dodge. Yuki smiles happily at Maki and for the first time Maki feels terror throughout her body. The difference in emotion is apparent in the fight and Maki is handily being beaten. About to accept her own defeat, Maki suddenly hears Kaori Sakiyama's loud yells! "Are you running away?! What will you do then?!" Maki, beaten ragged, stands up against Yuki saying, "I won't... lose. Fighting is all I know." The beach! Maki, Mina, Yuu, Michiru, and Renge had come to hang out and sun bathe together. Of course, Mina and her unbelievable breasts stood out conspicuously to attract the attention of anyone who passed by.While at the beach, Renge decided to enter Mina in the beach queen contest without ever telling her. Mina, who is very large breasted and a natural for such a competition is also very shy and at first, refuses to participate. However, Maki encourages Mina to partake and she agrees and then becomes determined to win the contest.At the same time, another competition, "The Beach Wrestling Queen Tournament," was being held at the same place. The tournament's previous winner with consecutive victories is a fighter that uses aerial killing techniques who does not appear to be an amateur. While watching the event, Maki is approached by a woman named Shizuna who hands her a flashy mask to encourage her to become a participant. Furthermore, a woman who calls herself "Supermodel of the future," who has already established a reputation for herself by fighting on shows, also appears to compete! An out-of-this-world tag team is born! And they're called the Fami-Wrestlers!Ignoring the matches listed on the card, this duo starts attacking one team after another! Kaori Sakiyama grabs a mic in the stunned crowd and gives an all-out performance! Feeling she should stop their fighting, a blood-thirsty pro wrestler named Mio Hayase appears. Sakiyama yells to her over the mic, "you look like you poisoned theprincess in the dragon castle and switched places with her!" No one can stop Sakiyama from egging on the fight! Or so they thought. Mio hits Sakiyama in the head and she collapses. Sakiyama's body may be completely worn out, but she rushes in through spirit alone! Due to Sakiyama's energy and yelling, Maki gets fired up and enters her battle mode! Everyone expects the super-strong pro wrestling duo of Mio Hayase and Sanpagita Kai to win and the bell rings! Mio is shocked at Maki's strength and quickly tags Kai. Kai says, "let me see who you really are!" when she stops to protect Mio and the letters SS are written on her back! Former gymnast, Aikawa Maki has turned her skills to street fighting. Violence being the only thing that makes her feel truly alive. With growing skill, she fights opponent after opponent, repeatedly demonstrating her signature gymnastic style which gives her the name that echos through the fighting community, "Air master".

Stringfellow Hawke is its pilot, essentially blackmailing a secret US agency into finding his brother (lost in Vietnam) while he flies dangerous assignments for "The Firm." When a train carrying supplies that could be used by Airwolf is hijacked, Archangel accuses Hawke of flying the mission. Soon after, though, Archangel learns of the existence of another super copter modeled after Airwolf. The copter's designer, Harlan Jenkins (Wings Hauser), was a protï¿½gï¿½ of Dr. Charles Moffett with an ego the size of Texas. He's convinced that he's a better pilot than Hawke and aims to prove it in an air-to-air duel of supremacy - a duel that is to take place just before Jenkins sells Airwolf II to foreign nationals. North and South Limbawe are in conflict over oil and a despotic General plans to overthrow his own government in South Limbawe and attacks his neighbors to the North. String and Dom are sent by Archangel to aid North Limbawe and it's leader, Seku Logana, but Logana has his own prejudices about receiving aid for his cause. Also in the mix is an old Vietnam buddy of Hawke's, Marty Vidor, who is working as a mercenary for South Limbawe, and Hawke is hesitant to take him on since Vidor just may know the location of the missing Saint John. leading aircraft designer, Robert Phelps, is abducted by foreign agents to the horror of his mentally challenged son, Bobby.

One of the men who stole it, thinking the man who hired him is shortchanging him calls the Firm and arranges a meeting. Michael sends Hawke and his people, because the meeting is taking place at a Wild West Show.

String and Caitlin travel to a deserted island where a cure is being researched for a biological plague that was developed in Afghanistan. Unfortunately, the plague has already gotten out of control and the researchers are all dead.

When String, Caitlin and the sub's crew all get exposed to the virus, they must work together to find the cure before they all go mad and either kill one another or die.

During Hawke's and his female friend's escape, she secretly drops the stub into the drawing box for a giveaway that was to occur at the end of the show. Both proceed to Airwolf, where they hastily eliminate the baddies. A group of terrorists steals a prototype in-flight computer that can turn any commercial aircraft into a fighting unit. While escaping, one of the terrorists is wounded and the group holes up in a small mountain community where they shanghai the services of a combat medic and lock his friends up in a storage shed. When the terrorists discover that the medic has flight skills as well, they get him to aid in their escape, but Doc manages to get away and finds String, who's out looking for the prototype with Airwolf. String manages to rescue Doc's friends, but he's injured in the process and Doc must fly Airwolf to prevent the terrorists from escaping with the prototype computer.

Even worse, the sinister Sheriff Waldren is on Mrs. Stewart's payroll. When a plane crash kills Greg, Mrs. Stewart realizes she will not be able to gain custody of her grandson, and threatens Rainey. The young mother hides her infant son with Dominic & Hawke, and Mrs. Stewart orders Waldren to employ any means to get him back.

Santini makes an unauthorized flight to Cuba in order to rescue two political prisoners who are being ransomed for $2 million. However, while there, the exchange site is attacked and the ransom money is stolen. While flying back to the mainland, Santini is forced to crash land back on Cuba and Hawke must brave a hurricane in Airwolf to rescue his friend. When String and Dom are reunited, the pair must negotiate with a band of freedom fighters who raised the capital to ransom their compadres and are not convinced of Santini's innocence in the theft of the funds. To make matters more interesting, Archangel is supplying weapons to a paramilitary band that just may have had a hand in stealing the ransom money. Dr. Robert Winchester is a brilliant researcher and a former test pilot who helped design Airwolf. Now, he's asking for Hawke's help in test flying a simulator that he's designed to enable the Firm to train future test pilots to fly Airwolf. Reluctantly, Hawke agrees, but determines that the simulator's "feel" is a little off. Archangel convinces Hawke to let Winchester hook up the real Airwolf to his computers in order to get a more realistic demonstration. This allows Winchester to engage in a little friendly flying competition with Hawke but it also allows the Russians to nearly get their hands on the high tech super copter. The Firm asks String to covertly shuttle a renowned researcher and diplomat, Dr. Roger Burton, to Russia for a secret meeting since Airwolf can get past the Russian defenses without being detected. Unfortunately, before Hawke can go back and recover Dr. Burton, a virus implanted by Airwolf's creator, the late Dr. Moffett, rears its ugly head and threatens not only the destruction of the supercopter but the elimination of the Firm as well unless a computer programmer String knows can undo the damage the evil Dr. Moffett concocted. A young hotshot helicopter pilot named Kevin takes a job sweeping the hanger at Santini Air after his guardian uncle is killed by some past associates. Those associates wanted his uncle to go back into the drug smuggling business with them. Now Kevin is on the lookout for them and uses his position at Santini Air to try to garner some revenge. Unfortunately, he costs Santini a commercial contract in the process and almost loses the trust of his newfound friends. String learns that Saint John may be held captive in a POW camp in Laos. Together with Dom, he recruits a couple of Vietnam veterans, one a daredevil, the other an up-and-coming politician, to go after his brother and bring him home. While they're in Cambodia, however, one of the team gets the jitters and reveals that he actually betrayed his comrades when they'd been captured by the enemy during the war. To that end, he not only has to redeem himself, but regain the trust of his companions. A movie producer hires Santini Air for a dangerous stunt involving the landing of a helicopter onto the roof of a moving semi. Dom and String nearly come to blows, however, when String tries to convince Dom that his reaction time might not be up to snuff for this particular action sequence. Things get even more dicey when it appears that the production might just be an elaborate cover for a high-stakes gold heist. String and Dom are hired to fly a helicopter rigged with a prop spaceship during a live concert performance by singing sensation Roxy Marvel (Misty Rowe). Complications develop, however, when a fight with her ex-husband Nick DeSoto (Mayf Nutter), who's also her manager, results in Nick having her kidnapped and replaced by a look-alike lip sync-her. Nick needs the money he can raise from his ex-wife's death to cover some old gambling debts. String and Dom must find Roxy and save her look-alike before DeSoto can carry out his plans. A revolutionary breaks her father, former dictator Marios Guzman, out of a military prison. Because her father received no medical treatment in prison, she has her followers kidnap Doc who is on a fishing trip with String. String vows to follow Doc, but is advised not to get himself or Airwolf involved in anything political. As it turns out, a former comrade-in-arms of Guzman's learns that he is dying and plans to use his final address to the people as a rallying point to retake the government. A Russian mole discovers that scientists in the U.S.S.R. have developed a lethal serum that instantly kills anyone exposed to it. He steals a vial of the serum and contacts his friend Archangel for help in escaping the country with his family. Archangel dispatches Hawke and Santini for the rescue effort, but Airwolf can't handle that much passenger weight -- unless all her armaments are stripped leaving the supercopter defenseless. When String and Dom agree to shoot some incidental film footage for a friendly rival, they accidentally stumble across a reputed mobster hiding out in the desert with plans for a secret rendezvous with his compatriots. The mobster sends his goons out to recover the film, but when their friend ends up being killed over the footage they shot, String and Dom work even harder to try to find out what's behind their friend's murder, even though a local detective isn't convinced about their findings. Dom uses Airwolf to transport a heart to Chicago and responds to a mayday along the way for a downed private plane. The plane belongs to billionaire Carl Barron who was on his way to a board meeting when his plane developed engine difficulties. Barron attempts to bribe Santini into dropping him off first, then the heart. Dom refuses and gives Barron a piece of his mind, instead. Shortly thereafter, Barron is killed in a mysterious explosion at his company and everyone at the funeral is shocked to learn that he altered his will just before he died. Dominic Santini is named as the recipient of a substantial piece of the Barron fortune and several of Barron's employees are not happy about it. Two senior analysts, Joe and Larry, are preparing to retire and open a seaside restaurant. When they apply for their pensions however, they are told that they don't qualify since they've been reclassified as non-employees. When Joe dies of a heart attack upon hearing the news, Larry (Arte Johnson) plans to release top secret information and it's up to String and Dom to calm him down and bring him back into the fold and expose the true traitor when information is released anyway. While demonstrating the capabilities of the new prototype supercopter codenamed 'Airwolf', Dr. Charles Moffet goes rogue, steals the chopper and kills almost all of the observers. At least one man -- Michael Coldsmith Briggs III survives. Briggs, codenamed 'Archangel' is the head of a covert organization called 'The Firm' and Archangel calls upon the one man in the world he knows that can retrieve the copter. The problem is Stringfellow Hawke is not only a loner, but a recluse as well. The amount of money the Firm is willing to pay for Airwolf's recovery is irrelevant. Hawke wants just one thing - the safe return of his brother, Saint John, who was captured during the Vietnam war and is evidently a POW. Four archeology students and their professor take a trip to South America to explore ancient ruins. Their bus driver, however, is in cahoots with a guerrilla leader named Alzar (John Aniston) and the kids are captured and treated as spies. Hawke learns of the capture and returns with Santini and Airwolf to rescue the kids and Caitlyn, but Airwolf is hit by a surface-to-air missile and limps away from Alzar's compound with the kids and Caitlyn, but Hawke and Ozzie, the museum guide, are left behind as prisoners. With Airwolf grounded and little hope of immediate rescue, the kids, Caitlyn and Dom must devise a plan to fix Airwolf and rescue Hawke before Alzar executes him as an American spy. Dom and String return to Dom's birthplace when Dom learns that his daughter has died of a drug overdose. After attending the funeral, they return to California where Dom is arrested on suspicion of murdering his ex-wife. String returns to the island to investigate the murder and learns that unsavory elements have begun taking over the seaside community where a casino is being developed. String finds himself pondering a burning question...does the casino's developer have something to do with the deaths of Dom's wife as well as his daughter? String and Dom investigate a small town where a friend of theirs has disappeared. What they discover there is a little fiefdom controlled by an unfriendly sheriff named Bogan who doesn't like outsiders in his domain. When String starts poking around for his friend, Bogan arrests him and sets him loose on an 80,000 acre wildlife enclosure just outside the town. There, he becomes the game in a little hunt that just may cost him his life. As if that isn't enough, an attractive highway patrol deputy has also run afoul of the Sheriff and String and Dom must intervene before she becomes fodder for the sheriff's goons. A former Vietnamese warlord, Tranh Van Zung (James Shigeta), terrorizes a small community of Southeast Asian immigrants by requiring them to pay a tithe like they would in their own country. A group of dissidents, however, stand up to the greed and refuse to pay. Subsequently, they are targeted for extermination by Tranh, who is an accomplished pilot. His men murder several of the members of the dissident faction -- that is, until String and Airwolf make a stand against Tranh's corruption and give the other immigrants a taste of what freedom is all about. Hawke is contracted to fly someone somewhere. He is later taken and subjected to some kind of brain washing. He then contacts Dom and Caitlin who tell them to bring Airwolf or else he will be killed. With little choice, they bring it and Caitlin hides in Airwolf when Dom arrives at the location. Michael gives her a drug that might counteract the brain washing. A rich corporate industrialist, Carter Anderson III, hires Santini and Hawke to ensure his safe transportation needs when it becomes evident that he might be targeted for a hit. Anderson is aware of the existence of Airwolf and Hawke agrees to use the supercopter to help protect Anderson if necessary. Caitlin agrees to fly one of the helicopters for the mission, but there's a twist that she's unaware of; her new boyfriend just might be in on the assassination plan. String and Dom rescue Dom's niece from her abusive boyfriend and return her to the U.S. Unfortunately, the boyfriend hasn't given up on her yet and sends his goons in search of her. Caitlin O'Shaughnessy (Jean Bruce Scott) re-enters the picture, asking Dom for a job at his hangar. Meanwhile, while trying to assimilate to life in the U.S., Holly (Barbara Howard) begins hanging out on a movie set with String and Dom. Not all is quite as it appears when a serious of incidents lead String and Dom to confront Holly's ex-boyfriend and they make a disturbing discovery that could lead Caitlin's death. Archangel warns String about a zealous government bureaucrat named D.G. Bogard who will stop at nothing until he finds Airwolf. Dom and Hawke take time out from shooting a military training film to hide Airwolf in a different location before it can be discovered, but Bogard catches on to their ruse and tracks Hawke back to the new hideaway. To complicate things, an eager pilot tails Dom and Hawke in an effort to convince Santini that she deserves a job working for his company. Hawke agrees to help paraplegics scale Sunusito mountain when a survivalist (the "Catman") decides to attack the hikers to protect his feral cats. Hawke has to get them to the chopper to save them. Dom and Caitlin use Airwolf to find them. With the crew earning some down time, and Airwolf some much-needed repair time, Dom takes a trip to help out an old war buddy. But he soon finds himself in the middle of both a family feud, and a dangerous drug-smuggling ring...without the help of Airwolf! The series has been revamped with an all new cast.

This weekly TV series replaces the series "Simpre en domingo" and features interviews, shows and acts by various artists in music, dancing, acting and other careers. An animated series based on the popular Disney movie of the same name. Hero Aladdin, Princess Jasmine, her father the Sultan, sly parrot Iago and monkey Abu team up with their old friend Genie to keep the land of Agrabah safe from the forces of evil. A street urchin is crazy enough to walk into the criminals club 'Dagger and Skull' and 'arrest' all the thieving or murderous members, barely rescued in time by his idolized 'role model' from the same gutter, Aladdin. Still determined to become a hero himself, the boy sneaks into Mechanikles' workshop, hiding inside the head of the latest addition to his mechanical army, not a bug but 'Junior', a giant metal copy of his master and thus finds himself in the right place to steer it by treading. Junior is meant and ordered to destroy Aladdin, but his new 'brain' rather defeats a minotaur to save him, and keeps 'rebelliously' doing good his maker considers bad-boy behavior, till the 'flying remote' is made operational... While the sultan plays another silly game against Aladdin, which Iago and Genie make sure he looses diplomatically, Queen Hippsodeth's Amazones overpower the palace guards and even Radjah to kidnap princess Jasmine on flying horses, to be trained and join them. The sultan insists to join the gang's rescue mission on Carpet. The enchanted Amazone land proves littered with traps, and the sultan refuses to be kept safely away, even recalls as a youth he broke in wild stallions, now priceless experience to handle a flying horse... The guards prove powerless against three tornadoes which mysterious sweep into Agrabah from the desert and rob the merchants. Aladdin is tempted to bet against them that his gang can follow and eliminate the thieving whirlwinds, otherwise Abu will be their to collar as slavish date picker. The find Abis Mal behind the black magic and take him on once more. When the apparently unstoppable Minotaur Dominus Tusk devastates Agrabah, the sultan himself uses the secret weapon which his father warned him only to risk as a last resort: armor which renders the wearer invulnerable and immensely strong. The sultan defeats the monster singlehandedly, but is also turned into an inflammable tyrant and warmonger, who not only plans to conquer the seven deserts and later the world but condemns Jasmine to death for resisting him. Aladdin and Jasmine discover the armor was cursed by Kilim, but getting the sultan out of it proves difficult and dangerous... Iago uses a magical diamond in Jafar's old tower room on another thievish treasure hunt. But it proves a portal, which makes him and Abu immaterial, semi-trapped in the netherworld with the sultan's late father Bobolius. Worse, evil sorcerer Ayam Aghoul sees them as his way out, or at least for revenge on all of Aladdin's gang. Aladdin, Jasmine, Abu and Genie head off on the Magic Carpet to open trade with Quirkistan. The gang is surprised to find Quirkistan a dreary wasteland; it turns out that the land is enchanted, and the weather and states of things are determined solely by the mood of king Mamoud, Quirkistan's bratty boy ruler. He's currently brooding over missing his birthday party, and as a result, the whole land is doomed. So, with the prospect of a rich treasure reward, the gang tries to cheer up the king. Aladdin comes close with his risky sword-juggling act, but only Jasmine's storytelling can engage Mamoud. But Jasmine will have to stay there and entertain Mamoud forever! Aladin and Genie are prospecting a new desert trade route to Agrazbah, riding Abu (as a camel), when they meet Mork, the ghost ship captain, who is mournful because the treasure-filled shark he chased all his life has been slain. Suddenly they are surprised by savage rodents who take instructions from an evil shaman, whose magic succeeds in capturing genie and draining his powers. Aladin manages to convince Mork they should team up, but without Genie's help it's a tough fight. In the end, it all hangs on turning the shaman's own wickedness against himself. Mozenrath has secretly taken up residence in Jafar's palace room and uses magical black sand which turns everyone who touches it into his slaves, oblivious of their true identity, from the Sultan's guards to Princess Jasmine, even Genie. Aladdin and his animals discover his plan to have the Sultan himself enchanted but find both Jasmine and Genie are replaced by mameluks who are given their appearance to approach His Majesty unnoticed, but fail to prevent his transformation. All seems lost when finally Aladdin is caught and dumped into the pool of oblivion, but Carpet dives after him with a rope fixed to a pillar, if only Abu and Iago can prevent Xerxes and Mozenrath from undoing it... When Genie finds two street urchins playing magical lamp, he can't resist telling them about the real thing and his share in Aladdin's adventures, soon rivaled by versions from Iago and, once both are gone, the villain in their versions, Abis Mal, who anonymously presents himself as the greater hero, and lures the kids into helping him to get the golden helmet of Scorpo the Indomitable, from a subterranean hiding place where the children are left behind with scorpions. Iago ad Abu attempt a rescue on their own, but as Iago breaks his wing can only stand by till Aladdin finally appears in the palace, where even Genie is frozen by the helmet... After a vacation, Aladdin's gang finds Agrabah in a terrible state, the inhabitants transformed into sludge-like wretches, even the royals, except palace guards captain Rasul. It's the doing of Aziz, the former acrobat in Minos's circus troop, who escaped from the Destiny Stone and gained immense magical power, enough to beat Genie. Iago is occupied looking for the Sultan's secret cache, or at least what Rasul whispered about one. Aziz even curses Aladdin and Rasul to be chained together unless they agree, which almost never happens, so the fight against Aziz looks hopeless... While the sultan and Genie prepare a banquet for another pompous princely suitor for princess Jasmine, who won't hear of another then Aladdin anyway, she's amazed to see him save a rat from the prince's hands. When her commoner lover replies he has lots in common with a real street rat, she takes Iago along for an incognito taste of street life, soon dared to prove herself as a thief. A blind merchant enchants the mirror she stole, so it transforms them into the first thing Iago unknowingly says they could be: she a rat, he a green lizard. Surviving without starving thus not only proves a good lesson about the life of Agraba's poor, it's quit an adventurous challenge to get to and into the palace alive, and past her pet tiger Rajah, who hates rats like everybody else but is naturally equipped as a deadly vermin hunter... In another absurd attempt to seduce Aladdin, Sadira has enchanted him to forget about Jasmine and concentrate solely on fighting monsters. The princess finds out and gets Genie to use counter-magic. The result for Aladdin is utterly confused, hence most unsafe on such missions as dragon-slaying, but he may not find out what embarrassment he has been put trough. Abis Mal intends to seize the throne by making a magic potion to give him immense strength, but it requires the claw of a griffin. He and Haroud haven stolen a griffin egg, but Aladdin's gang manages to get it from them, even if it costs Aladdin some broken ribs, causing Jasmine and -worse- Genie to be determined to nurse and protect the bruised, indignant hero on the journey to return it to its mother in Getistan. There the word casino suffices to make Iago stick to the local ruler, sultan Pasta Al-Dente, and mother griffin is dangerously impatient, while the fiends soon arrive to steal her egg back... The gang laughs when Princess Jasmine is swept over by a wave, but the next one drags her into a vortex, down to a magically sealed sea section, the domain of mermaid-witch Saleen. It takes a while until even Genie works out she's using magic against them, desiring Aladdin for herself. Then the gang must save Jasmine. Evil Morgana bets against blind sorcerer Fasir whether love can conquer all, the test case being Aladdin and Jasmine. So she tricks the princess into buying a 'beauty cream' which actually turns her into a monstrous, poisonous snake-monster. Still Aladdin joins her on a dangerous quest with Genie to the Tree of Renewal. Morgana keeps piling up obstacles. Abis Mal steals the blue rose from the mystical monks' temple, which makes people who smell it oblivious. It is taken over by Aladdin, but Abis Mal and Haroud get it back, so they can enter the sultan's palace, attempting a coup. Princess Jasmine forgets she loves Aladdin, who is therefore thrown back into the gutter by a grinning Rasul, and even who she is, so Jasmine can be made to believe she is Abis Mal's daughter, an evil desert bandit, and help him seize her real father's throne, but Aladdin isn't the only one who surprises the would-be tyrant unpleasantly... When Agraba has been without rain for so long that the last fig trees are dying, Iago and Genie realize the solution can be found is the parrot's native rain forest, where legend has it all rain clouds come from. There Aladdin and his gang follow a rainbow and find at the end that its abundant clouds are magically controlled by the jungle queen, rain bird Thundra. She is instantly smitten with uninterested Iago, who is nevertheless -against Jasmine's leap- tricked into asking her for rain, and after she refuses keeps her busy while Genie steals a cloud. Thundra soon notices after Iago escapes her tender but smothering embrace, and brings all her thunder and lightning... Storm and lightning-king Pector proposes to the Amazon queen Hippsodeth, but she refuses to consider another then the only man who ever beat her, the sultan of Agrabah. She even sends him a love-letter which doubles as a duel-challenge. Jasmine gets hold of it and, fearing for her father, gets Aladdin to dress like him to take the test instead. Jago adds an insult to the reply. Pector decides to revenge his beloved's honor, in Agrabah. Aladdin meanwhile runs the gauntlet of Amazon traps. Twenty years ago, as a youngster, the sultan picked a flower for his bride from semi-vegetable Arbutus's magical garden. Now he's haunted in nightmares by his promise to pay his release with his greatest treasure, which expires now. Aladdin and the gang guard the palace's rich treasury, to realize only when the sultan screams in his dream the real target: Jasmine. Arbutus's invincible spiked vines abduct her to his garden, to be incorporated in his designs of magically sprouted growth. By the time Aladdin's sultanic rescue party arrives, she has learned to understand her captor. Iago and Abu try to steal from the thieves club, but get caught. Then arrives a mukhtar, a reptilian killer, a race skilled in tracking and killing genies, who rides a dinosaur. Genie was pretending to Aladdin that giving the palace tiger Raja a bath didn't scare him, so he tries to deal with the mukhtar without the hero, but after some fancy escapes gets trapped in a bottle. Aladdin and the animals chase them on Carpet and manage to steal Genie back, after the mukhtar told he no longer kills but hunts, for pay. Aladdin figures he must have been hired by a former master who wants Genie back; they track down the old man who once traded Genie for eternal life... Jasmine buys a broken insect toy, which turns out a dangerous flying attack weapon when daddy the sultan repairs it; Aladdin takes credit for its elimination, actually by Genie and Carpet, and volunteers the gang to examine if there are more. When they trace it to a town where the winged bugs are called the golden plague, the scenario is repeated and Aladdin is celebrated as hero, but a survivor informs their creator, Greek genius Mechanicles, who sends a series capable of capturing Carpet and even Genie, undoing Aladdin's local hero status. The mortal gang liberates them by provoking Mechanikles' obsession with neatness, but thus only makes him awake his most dangerous, gigantic bug... Agrabah is thrilled and chilled by a first-ever visit from the caliph Kapoc, a reputed magician. Actually it's only his magically severed head, which wines his body is meanwhile terrorizing his people. Aladdin and the gang travel there to reunite them. Only while succeeding, they learn the head is the evil part, which scorns emotions and instantly turns on them. Aladdin's own head is also severed, with a similar effect. While the gang enjoys discovering fireworks, the blind seer Fasir stops time to tell Iago it is his destiny, but only his, to awake a terrible monster and destroy it again or perish trying so, and hands the bird a magical locket. Iago tries to escape his fate by convincing Aladdin to take the gang on a far 'holiday' abroad, but it's precisely there that Genie flies them into a rock temple where an ancient evil lies dormant- in his attempt to get out, Iago accidentally lights the fire which awakes Amok Mon-Ra, a giant ogre who once ruled Agrabah and now returns to it for a reign of terror. The others ignore it was Iago who awoke Amok, so Genie believes it's up to him to destroy it but keeps failing, while Iago flees, till his conscience finally catches up... Agraba and first its confines are terrorized by metal bugs. Aladdin takes too much credit for chasing them without properly acknowledging Genie did most of the work. The gang works out the creator is Mechanikles, a Greek genius mechanical inventor. After a booby bug endangers the sultan, they set out to tackle the problem at the root. Mechanicles proves resourceful enough to handle anything, except dirty chaos. While mapping a river area on a float for the sultan, Aladdin and the gang come across a peasant village put in flames by magical fireballs, brought from her flying Egyptian temple by the 'fire cats' of the sorceress Mirage which nobody knew. Next morning they find they are back where they started, after an unnoticed nightly intervention from Mirage, who appears as Jasmine, and then shows them they're actually in Morphia, her magical make believe-realm. Her target is Genie, whose powers she can steal while he's afraid... Iago hoped for a commercial bonanza on Agrabah's Founder's Day, but during the sultan's celebration speech in memory of his Bedouin ancestor Hamed, the city's founder, a witch uses a magical hourglass to open a time portal, trough which Abis Mal jumps without his faithful Haroud to change the city's history, putting his bloodline on the throne. So Aladdin and his gang jump after him, hoping to cross the 'Abysmal' plan then as they always manage here and now. Jasmine motivates her ancestor Hamed, still a mere caravan merchant, but Abis his, camel-driver Abnor. Abis Mal also brought the hour-glass and has the sultan-to-be thrown trough another portal to the dinosaur age, which makes Jasmine disappear too; this time only Aladdin and Genie get trough, just in time, and so on, even crazier when the hourglass gets broken so various ages mix into a time continuum... While Aladdin and Carpet flew higher then ever, Abu and Iago made such a mess in the palace that Jasmine and Aladdin nearly persuaded the Sultan to throw them out of the palace. Then fairies arrive, who busily show a magical mess is even worse, only it takes a while 'til people realize their mischief is not the gang's work. They prove well-meaning but infantile, as playful and tireless as puppies, but magical fliers who can give Aladdin and the amused royals sky-rides, making Carpet feel superfluous, while Iago's attempt to make Abu feast with table-manners goes wrong in no time. Alas, the fairies won't accept the humans get tired and want to return, instead they lift the whole palace 'so you must never leave' and trick Genie into a knot, unable to stop it crashing down when the fairies leave because their playmates refuse to keep frolicking, only Carpet tries to save them smashing to smithereens inside the falling palace... Nefir finds his engineering dwarfs team unable to infiltrate the manifold magically protected tree-tower where they captivated the panacea-caterpillar whose golden silk cures everything, so he plans to get Aladin's Genie to do the job by poisoning Aladin. Indeed Genie must now beg Nefir, the only one who knows the site, for 'help' and brave with him and Iago the daunting dangers, some of which no mortal would survive. Once Genie has the silk ball un-twined to cut some off as medicine, Nefir tricks him into a bottle, but soon must release him begging for help, realizing the horrible prophesy comes true: the ancient moth which Genie released from the cocoon is a pestilent wrecker of whole cities, which feeds on dwarfs only... Aladdin feels guilty he never manages to give Jasmne the romantic evening she craves, and angry at Abu, Iago and Genie, who all too often mess it up for the lovers, everywhere. Still, when a bones-reader predicts Aladdin can find a treasure at full moon on an island, just the evening he promised to take Jasmine 'just us two', he's happy to take Iago's excuse: an island is a romantic retreat. Genie and carpet secretly tag along, searching while he keeps Jasmine -not quite- amused, but soon she notices and allows the gang to continue treasure-hunting. Only when the monstrous guardian werewolf turns into a pretty girl in startled Aladdin's arms, his princess comes close to turning into loveless monster... Iago and Abu's thievish 'instincts' get them in trouble again in Agraba, but while Aladdin saves them from merchant Omar's wrath, he gets the same nightmarish vision as Abu, about voices crying for help from a citadel city on a high mountain. Carpet brings them there, Zigurock, where the shaman welcomes carpet as bringer of the prophesied savior from ancient evil which makes foraging terribly dangerous, only his giant statue fits not Aladdin but his monkey! Aladin leads his gang into the jungle, where the danger proves ancient indeed: a live dinosaur with a tail that can smash even Genie, who uses explosives to bury the monster. Alas, during the nightly liberation feast it crawls out of the rock rumble, and this time attacks the city, knocking out Iago, Carpet, Aladdin and Genie in turn: now it's really up to savior Abu to save everybody against odds, if he can... Aladdin leads another caravan trough the desert. The gang is delighted to find and frolic in an unchartered oasis. Of course it was too good to be trough: suddenly a mud creature pulls the plug and a vortex gobbles up the, unlike the sultan's guards. They fall into the underground dwelling of Mudder, an evil spirit consisting of mud, who can assume every shape. And the cannibal greats them as soup ingredients. Aladdin must outsmart him to escape and save the others. Aladdin is miserable, even feels unworthy of the royal family, after being unable to keep up with posh conversation at a court dinner, where rich merchant Daru stole the show with wit and oratory. Jago volunteers to teach him a crash-course fake culture and manners which impresses the gang, but not Jasmine, and still proves no match for slick Daru. The guards report a fire-breeding centipede-like monster is turning the desert into glass, so the gang rides and faces what turns out to be Mechanicles's latest invention. Overcoming it brings a surprise bonus. Aladdin and his gang minus Jasmine fly to Waristan, the Las Vegas of the seven deserts, for a holiday; Iago can't wait to try his gambling system in a casino. To their astonishment the local sultan Pasta says it's normal to see his whole city in ruins, it's rebuild daily by Nefir and his team of magical dwarfs, because every night it's completely trampled to rubble by the smashing ballet of the giant rhinoceros Samir the Destroyer. Aladdin's remark how crazy that is gets taken as an offer to deal with Samir, but after failed attempts by Genie, Nefir offers to built a catapult, yet soon is found to have his own agenda, involving magical dance shoes, which Aladdin's side fights in a musical duel... After removing a bunch of Al-muddi monsters from a desert area, seemingly monsters 'as usual', Aladdin is convinced he earned a romantic luxury night alone in the palace with Jasmine. Genie refuses to bother him, even after Jago discovers some mud caught in his plumage actually reassembles as a voracious, quick-growing Al-muddi again. All their efforts do deal with it without the hero ultimately result in multiplication out of control. While in the Frozen North everyone is having fun in the snow when Iago sees the palace of the Ice Efreet and pleads with the others to explore and look for treasure. He is certain the palace is abandoned but that is not the case and they wake up the the Efreet named Frajhid. he is an ice wizard who is not quite as intimidating as he first appears to be. He journeys with Aladdin back to Agrabah and impresses everyone with his ice tricks. But before long he is turning Agrabah into a frozen ice city. While the gang acts as tiny caravan to the Far East, Aladdin helps Chinaman Zhin Lao, who is attacked in the mountains by a pack of wolves, then takes him with them as he's unconscious with sunstroke. When Zhin wakes up in the city Pelin they thought he headed for too, he panics: it's the city of evil, in the form of a Chinese dragon. In fact Zhin himself is the one who gets magically transformed into one. Aladdin is rewarded for capturing the monster with a load of silk, but it escapes. Zhin reappears, as well as his evil-maker, who to the Arabs looks identical and strikes again, later Zhin explains their magical link... When the sultan learns a sunk ship has lost a gold cargo, a 10% salvage fee is fixed. Jasmine agreed that's a job for the famous nautical hero captain Albaross, an immensely strong but arrogant macho European. Iago wants the reward and Aladdin the honor, so he enlists as the captain's only crewman, with the animals and Genie's help. In the feared Neptune's triangle, Aladdin and Albatross find the chest and have it hoisted, but are then both captured by a giant octopus- it's actually another steam-vessels constructed by Mechanicles, who planned his fatal revenge on Aladdin. The others dive to the rescue; the ship's water intake swallows them up, after everyone escapes a whale does the same, and the heroes' rivalry isn't nearly settled yet... Iago's greed gets him to make Genie pierce a palace ceiling so gold dust pours down from the sultan's treasury. Once covered in gold, he runs off, openly posing as greed incarnated, but is too heavy to fly and everybody wants to pluck his golden feathers. When Abis Mal and Haroud see Iago, they think it's the legendary bird whose trail leads to a treasure. When found and washed by the gang, Iago agrees greed makes unhappy, vows poverty and gives all their precious souvenirs away, preaching everyone must do the same and salesman Akbar becomes his disciple, yet even free valuables cause strife and the unconverted are still looking for the golden bird. After Haroud recognizes it was Iago Abis Mal kidnaps him and Abu, but he only finds a surprising treasure. Meanwhile the Sultan has sent the palace guards to arrest the treasury robber... When a giant desert worm attacks Agrabh, attracted by the stench of cheese, Iago's bright idea to dispose of the lure works after Genie executes it. While Aladdin enjoys a holiday on carpet with the princess, the saviors dispute each-other the merit. To settle that, Genie accepts to transfer his semi-cosmic powers to the parrot for a day. Iago seems to make such clever use of them that genie fears he'll have to transfer them for good. But too much wealth and rain also proves dangerous for a desert city. Aladdin is frustrated because he can only spoil Jasmine with the sultan's money, he wants to earn his own. He gets his chance when Agrabah is shocked by the crushing arrival of a gigantic shark who cruises trough the seven deserts, his immense fin slashing even the palace walls. It's being chased by the flying ship of captain Mirk, because it's so full of treasure that when it jumps gold and gems fall from its belly. Mirk offers half the treasure to whoever enlists to help him kill the shark, so Aladdin volunteers, but Jasmine insists to follow him in order to see the city out of shark danger, so the whole gang joins. They soon find the danger is terrible because Mirk shirks no risk, when he hears Jasmine wants the gang to return he actually abandons her in the desert by night... Iago seduces the magical rain-bird Thundra, pretending he's the sultan's indispensable minister but made time for her. After her claim she can't be missed at all, he first questions how hard her job is, then insists to stand in so she can have a holiday. Het gets the book and amulet, which are meanly tested on Genie and Abu. It soon gets out of control, so Malcho, the evil jungle dragon, from whom Thundra once took them, can steal them back. the whole gang is mobilized while Thundra returns in panic. Time-sorcerer Sarastro's gang robs, in the sultan's absence, a caravan from a country which threatens to go to war with Agrabah. Aladdin only escapes by pretending to join Sarastro, which palace guard captain Rasul actually believes. The ambassadors make Jasmine engage the Riders of Ramont (from "The Sands of Fate") and imprison Aladdin, but she sets him free to join the Riders' mission, only to be captured with them and Aladdin's entire gang. Sand witch Sadira has put a spell on Agrabah so all people and even Genie believe she is the princess and Jasmine a street criminal. When Rajah attacks her, she realizes it doesn't work on animals; she fails to cage the tiger, Iago and Abu, then sends Rasul's guards to bring them in, which only succeeds after they found Jasmine, and Iago has a single success: seeing Aladdin and Sadira riding to the sultan's palace for their official engagement, her heart catches flame for her true love again. They are all thrown in the dungeons on Sadira's orders, but escape before the ceremony... Amin Dimoola gets caught again, trying to steal in the crime guild club 'dagger and skull'. After too many clues to miss, Aladdin takes his gang shopping for a locket as Jasmine's birthday present. The nasty, rude vendor takes his gold instead for a stinking teddy-bear, but Iago who hopes the princess's favor is the key to plenty of palace pleasures steals as his present a magic box. When he opens it, an enchanted cuddly creature jumps out, which pleases her with cuteness and Iago as he realizes it grants wishes each time it gets scared, so he substitutes it at night, but is unable to scare it and it gets in Amin's hands... Even a treasure-map from crazy Sahib was irresistible for Iago; the gang finds nothing at the X, but it brings them at a spot on the beach where a hooded skeleton herald rises from the sea who lures Iago and Abu to a haunted treasure ship on the bottom and gives them a magical conch to blow and set things in motion, but it's physically too daunting for them alone, so Iago plays a ghost to make Aladdin believe there's a damned sailor there who needs to be rescued. The conch makes the sea part. Before Genie can remember the legend and catch up, Aladdin is tricked into touching the bow's figurehead, which makes him change places with the cursed magician Ayam Aghoul, who quickly catches the animals... When the guardian of the Temple of Fortune comes for Aladdin's help saying the Destiny Stone, which makes it possible for ordinary people to do extraordinary things, is broken, the hero first tells the rest of the gang how he met Abu. The monkey was the unappreciated main income of Minos's circus act, who picked the audience's pockets, and one day Aladdin's nearly empty purse. Impressed with Aladdin's performance getting it back, and even stealing Minos's full purse, Minos's accomplice Fatima convinces him to enlist the street rat as purse-snatcher, and indeed he does better then Abu, who is now further scorned. Only ever fair and generous newbie Aladdin generously shares his -half- share with the monkey. Hearing a victim's desperate family weep they are cleaned out, Aladdin donates them the rest of his profit. Next morning Aladdin refuses to continue that way, and is surprised the circus gang agrees: instead he is sent into the temple, to pass the elaborate traps and get the magical stone... Now Aladdin has explained to his gang how how Minos's got caught in the Destiny Stone, they follow the guardian's call but find the temple empty, and can barely escape before it completely explodes. The three thieves have been transformed into criminally genial monsters, who cause havoc in all Agrabah, unstoppable, even invading the Sultan's palace. Still the true love between Aladdin and Jasmine makes an appeal to that between Fatima, who acted most evil, and Minos, convincing enough for reconsider, only Aziz is totally committed to evil... Even Aladdin thought the sultan's visitor, a sultana showing interest in his toy collection, might be a suitable match, but she turns out to be nobody else then evil sorceress Mirage. Worse, she brought Agrabah a black magical 'gift': a giant black obelisk, the shadow of which makes everything it touches disappear, and nothing Genie tries can break or move it. Then Mirage tells Aladdin the only remedy is the mirror which reflects the truth behind the appearance, to be found on the roof of the world. The gang minus Genie fly till they find the ice cage full of mirrors, and Aladdin chooses one which shows him back in street rat costume. When they return and the mirror successfully removes shadow and obelisk, Princess Jasmine finds her fear was justified that's all too easy: now Mirage tells her true plan was to create an elaborate trick-reality to mislead them while the real Agrabah is wiped out, but Genie and Aladdin also have a surprising trick up their sleeves... Aladdin and the gang travel by ship to return to Agrabah an ancient statue of great symbolic value. The wicked mermaid Saleen, who has a crush on the hero, set a trap aided by her octopus crony Amad. Genie saves everybody from shipwreck, but Aladdin ends up caught in a magical bell where she can cause him to mutate into her pet shark, which even turns on his own gang. Aladdin and the gang (without Jasmine) are not exactly pleased to learn the surprise they were asked to hurry to Stenchenia for is an annual festival devoted to the horribly reeking cheese. It's actually even worse, for a peddler brought along an egg from a lizard species which has a breath that chemically combines with the cheese stench to a dragon breath-mixture that flattens even the Stenchenians, so the giant men go down all green all over the place... While helping to catch a thief, Genie gets a cold and can't control his magic. Unless they can find a cure, it could last a century! Iago reluctantly assists Aladdin while Princess Jasmine and Abu watch over Genie. Aladdin must pass some treacherous obstacles to find the cure before Genie's cold gets worse. On the way back from Stenchenia, Genie's 'semi-phenomenal sense of orientation' gets Aladdin, Iago and Abu utterly lost in snowy mountains, where they enter the castle of the snowman Yeti, who refuses them passage until Genie starts entertaining him magically. Iago convinces Aladdin to sneak trough to the greens side, happy with some peace and quiet till Genie catches up, but the Yeti captures him in a bottle, desperately performing for his life till Aladdin gets worried enough to turn back, climb into the castle and free Genie, but Yeti chases them outside, with a surprising result... Abis Mal and his loyal Haroud stole Genie's lamp, so he, Aladdin and Abu chase them, although it no longer controls him since Aladdin wished his freedom, he's just attached to his humble 'home'. During the carpet voyage, Genie sees and instantly falls in love with a green, female genie living in a bottle. During their date that evening, Abis Mal and Haroun overpower her present master, a dumb street girl, looking for her lamp-equivalent and thus get magical control over her and attack Aladdin and Abu after making her lock Genie in a safe on the bottom of the sea, but... Aladdin and the gang visit Odiferous, where stench is highly prized. Prince Uncouthma, once Aladdin's rival for princess Jasmin's, now invites them to his wedding with local yak-herd Brawnhilda. But the bride considers 'weak puppy' Aladdin so much more desirable that she leaves the prince at the altar. His foreign grand vizier pushes for a duel, hoping to switch the weapons for lethal ones so he can usurp the smelly throne. Aladdin helps Sadira, a street thief, quick and sassy like he once was, escape Rasul's guards. She clings to her savior and turns jealously against his fiancï¿½e, princess Jasmine, a rival she couldn't dream of matching. By chance, she discovers the secret subterranean hideout of the sand-witches, who terrorized the land from Agrabah 3000 years ago. She decides to turn their power on the princess, but soon looses control of the invulnerable sand-monster she conjured. Iago gets Carpet to bring him and Abu to the forbidden oasis. When the animals try to steal a golden ring, Carpet can barely save them from murderous vines. Jasmine is grumpy at Aladdin as if he took her for granted. When the giant prince Grobertus of Stenchenia arrives by yak to bid for the princess's hand, she and the sultan welcome him, although he and his traditional courting reek insufferably after terribly old cheese. When Aladdin claims to be her fiancï¿½e, the prince challenges him to a traditional duel by spiky club, but Jasmine says her hand is only won by kindness- when Aladdin says he's the friendliest, she scorns him again and grants the prince an evening. Aladdin 'advices' him deliberately badly, but the royals are determined to sit trough the Stenchenian customs, and Jasmine notices Aladdin and Genie, so she makes him throw a melon at that window. Iago makes the giant believe the vines from the oasis are the ideal courting gift. Aladdin takes her and the gang to save the prince and his yak, Iago and Abu try again to steal the ring, but that proves to be fixed into the nose of a gigantic monster, the vines are its hair... Carpet flies the gang to a magical kingdom, with a dammed stream filled by precious stones. Aladdin breaks an arm jumping after a koala who tried to climb out, the talking animals debate whether to reward him or eliminate him as a danger to the valley's secret, compromising to incarcerate the hero. When Iago and Abu gather gems as 'pension fund' their breaking causes the dam to start leaking. When Genie is caught too, Carpet makes the animals part with their loot -Iago reluctantly- while freeing the others, but the water breaks trough... Mozenrath has found, after seven years, the magical book of Khartoum, which promises to get him the secret for ultimate cosmic power of that great magician, who was captivated it in ages ago. Mozenrath manages to activate it, and it shows him how to make a philosophers stone, the key to power. The missing ingredient is enough magic to heat the magical oven. Thereto Mozenrath cleverly captures Genie, masquerading as a coachman. Aladdin, Iago and Abu on Carpet and Genie's girlfriend, a green genie, come to his rescue, but are expected, worse: the green genie is wanted to supplement Genie's insufficient power... Agraba is plagued by a flying dragon and a serpent named Xerxes, but those are only meant as a test, which indicates Aladdin as the hero required for the purpose of their master, the sinister sorcerer Mozenrath, who forces him to come to his magical kingdom in the black sands, where he has overpowered the previous king, whom even mighty Jafar feared, and reduced him to one of his mamluks (undead skeleton slave-soldiers). Aladdin must help Mozenrath by putting a magical collar on the neck of a tirbac, a magical monster which swallows all magical beings, and therefore chases both his flying carpet and Genie... Iago shamelessly bathed in the sultans balms, but thus inadvertently fell into a trap Abis Mal and Haroun set to blackmail his majesty: it will petrify him by evening unless he exchanges the antidote for all Aghraba. No last luxury can console Iago, even Aladdin's promise to save him. Genie suggested that it must have been the effect of a stone ivrite (winged monster)'s poison, but isn't believed. Iago resolves to do a deal with the crook, but at the last minute can't go trough with it. Meanwhile Aladdin and Genie have learned from the hag who sold the monster that the antidote is made from its tail-scales. Iago was mounting a tourist map business, but the sultan's city gets a less welcome visitor. Just after Jasmine has a nightmare prophesying Agrabah's destruction, it hails in summer followed by an earthquake and a plague of giant scorpions. Finally the Ethereal appears for real, announcing judgment over Agrabah's civilization after an inspection, at risk of destruction. No material, intellectual or artistic treasures make a redeeming impression. The magical spear Genie forges can't avert the Ethereal either, so it starts the apocalyptic sequence. Abis Mal wants to eliminate Aladdin's gang by using contagious mood stones, Mechanicles by another series of mechanical insects, rivaling each-other the 'privilege', but after robber leader Akbar knocks some sense in them they join forces and set a trap in a cave to imprison Aladdin's party, then release tiny flying bugs to infect each of them -turning Jago into a womanizer, Jasmine envious, Abu into a ridiculer, Aladin fearful, Genie stuck-up- and a giant mechanical preying mantis to devour them all... Genie presents anachronistic games such as croquet and baseball but keeps loosing from carpet. Dwarf sorcerer Demir takes to Genie's unsuspecting word he'll give anything to win: he and his jealous female partner take the whole gang to their Arctic home as living toys for endless games like bobsled and mountain-climbing, till they die, with added dangers like a polar bear and lava, no helping allowed... When the ruins of the centuries long lost desert city of Mesmeria are found, the Sultan sends Aladdin and his gang. They dig up a chest with four magical jewels, but one is immediately nicked by a hawk, pursued in vain by treasure-horny Iago. It's Mesmeria's enchanted king, who resurrects the emerald into his evil queen Daluqa, who against his loving warning steals the other three and resurrects them as her three ever striving brothers, in Agraba, all with frightful magical amulets, and alas their anger feeds a great monster, which tramples whole buildings... While Aladdin, Genie, Iago, Abu and Jasmine chase a thief, she gets abducted herself, next the other mortals. Genie learns it's the work of the ghost warriors of the evil 'mukhtar', a magic-spotter who wants in exchange for her release Genie's help to defeat Mozenrath in his enchanted realm of the black sand. There Genie saves mukhtar's life, only to be sold to Mozenrath, who traps him in a magical crystal. Yet the mukhtar delivers the mortal friends, as his honor debt to Genie, only to be caught one by one in Mozenrath's magic, but... Aladdin eagerly accepts, to Iago's horror, to help the bothersomely busy sprites when their whole people is reported by the only one who got away to be captured by evil sorcerer Mozenrath, forced to dig in the desert sand for indications where he can find the secret of the Lost City of the Sun, which contains the key to the immense power of the ancient Shamash, a magical sun. Fortunately Mozenrath and his aid Xerxes haven't yet found the ultimate clue mentioned in all ancient inscriptions, the pointing Hand, but on Carpet Aladin does. Alas, Mozenrath catches on, so a duel for the solar power is inevitable... Agrabah lives in fear of nocturnal disappearances of children. Aladdin remembers it once happened to Amal, his best mate as street urchin. The gang finds it's the doing of an El-katib, a reptilian monster wearing ragged shorts which can appear for three nights at full moon only once every seven years from and disappear into the land of shadows. He fails to keep urchin Wahid safe, even on Carpet, but finds it is the doing of the evil feline sorceress Morgana... Iago is sure it must be Thundra the rain-controlling jungle princess longing for him when a tiny cloud enters Aladdin's house. Alas she was sending a distress signal ahead: her rain forest is disappearing, she can't stop it and risks running out of water. The gang finds even magically replanting doesn't help because the problem are termites, but not real ones: an army of mechanical bugs constructed by Mechanikles, so the gang tries to take him on and is instantly caught, but they came prepared too... A thousand years ago, the cyclops (one-eyed giant) Fashum, who used his single 'eye of terror' to rob an immense treasure from a thousand caravans, was petrified by his brother Fasir, now a blind seer, who prophesies in cryptic terms what's going to happen to Aladdin. First Carpet is lured by Abis Mal and his servant Haroud Hazi Bin using a pink lady-carpet and press-ganged using moths to serve them, not just to fly on but to power a ship to fly to Fashum's castle which floats in the air. Aladdin and his gang give chase, the pedestrians are caught in a net but thus hoisted into the castle, where Abis robs the eye from the petrified giant, which revives the murderous monster... Aladin has a nightmare about failing now he must replace the sultan, while everyone else except Iago is on holiday, even Genie. Just now the demonic basilisk (winged serpent dragon) Malcho, whom Iago got banished in polar ice, returns to Agrabah. Only Iago sights the monster but isn't believed on his word; when he finds a dragon feather as proof it's after him, the guards throw the parrot out 'in the country's best interest', but Aladdin snatches him back in, just on time to prevent Iago being eaten alive, so the dragon intrudes the palace and the duel starts, in several rounds, reluctantly helped by the guards, who would rather surrender the troublesome bird... . Aladdin enjoyed a quiet spot in the desert, the others called it tame. Then suddenly they see the Riders of Ramont, brave but arrogant mounted knights escorting a treasure, attacked by masked, also mounted robbers. Aladdin tries to help, but by the time Carpet brings him near them, both groups suddenly disappear. At a campfire, the blind seer Fasir explains it's a great mystery how they were all doomed by the Riders' magical crystal, which is the treasure, to repeat the episode over and over again. Aladdin insists to try to help them, but is ignored then at the next attempts he, Abu and even Genie get caught up in the action and become part of he cursed scene. Only Iago, who wanted to walk away from the start, remains... On excursion at Dagger Rock, Aladdin is trapped into a black kind of quicksand which swallows him into the power of Mozenrath, who orders the princess to bring him Genie as ransom, behind the sultan's back. First they take the place of two of Rasul's soldiers, who suddenly must fight an army of undead mamluks, no match for Genie and carpet as Xerxes reports, even Mozenrath's giant fists of rock fail to crush them literally. While untying Aladdin, Genie entangles himself in the black stuff, gets out, but then Mozenrath uses a magic-trapping crystal, Aladdin tries to anchor him with the black stuff, only then... Genie is proud as a peacock when he and Aladdin are appointed Agrabah's honorary diplomats accompanying the Sultan on a state visit to fellow Sultan Pasta Al-Dente of Getzistan, but can't remember the diplomatic rules of conduct. Abis Mal and Haroud secretly followed to kidnap the sultan and seize power in Agrabah, armed with a bomb which shatters genies. However throwing it at Genie doesn't make him disappear, he is just split up in seven Genies embodying aspects of his boisterous personality. When everybody finds out what has happened, Genies are enlisted either pro - or contra the coup. Ayam Aghoul is banished to the underworld and has found a way to take revenge. He brings his shadow to life with powers to corrupt the shadows of Aladdin's gang and the sultan. If their shadows don't return to them and rest at night in the Shadowland, both shadows and the people they belong to will die, ending up in the underworld with Ayam. Genie takes Aladdin on a desperate expedition to the Shadowland. The gang digs up from an old well a trunk full of magical spice, in turn containing a golden neck-lace with a moving stone, which evokes a storm. When Aladdin gives it to Jasmine and she puts it on, this resuscitates the evil sorcerer Ayam Aghoul, lord of the undead, who commands skeletons and decides to wed Jasmine and move into a harem he builds magically annex to the palace. Meanwhile Iago and Ghost sold the spice they can't use themselves, so Genie does the magic. Ayam proves a though adversary, even for Genie. Aladdin realizes Ayam can be contained only by returning in the neck-lace in the spice, if he can get it back while Genie and the royals stall the wedding... In disguise Abis Mal sells Jasmine a powder, claiming it's a cheaper and better burning fuel. Believing this could help her people Jasmine gives it to the kingdom despite Aladdin's reservations. They soon realize that, when burned, the power produces a smoke creature trained to steal for Abis Mal. Agrabah and a neighboring city go to war, only to be edged on by a two-timing assistant who claims to be supporting Agrabah, but is also supporting the invaders, providing each of the warring sides with better weapons when he gets the other to pay up, for a pretty penny.

On March 21, 1963, the inmates and guards at Alcatraz prison mysteriously disappear. To cover up the problem, the government reports to the public that the prison has been closed because of unsafe conditions. A secret government unit was set-up to find the prisoners. Now, in the present-day, the inmates begin returning - unaged and unaware of where they have spent the missing decades - and continue their criminal ways. They are acting out of character and appear to be searching for specific objects. A federal agent employs a police officer and a conspiracy theory novelist to help track them down. Cal Sweeney, the next Alcatraz prisoner to mysteriously reappear, resumes his MO of robbing banks, where he seduced a female teller clerk, limiting himself to the private boxes, not the safe, and returning with his loot to one client. Alas he is now more violent, once being surprised, next at a home. He's caught by helping him escape before a SWAT attack after his last robbery is detected. In 1960, Cal ran the prison's semi-condoned black market, training junior cell neighbor Harlan Simmons to become his deputy. After deputy warden E.B. Tiller confiscated the empty metal box Sweeney treasures above all, Harlan assists his plan to make a deal during the fancy birthday party the warden hosts for Tiller's anniversary, but that ends in bloody disappointment. Hauser and his back-room team care only for the key Sweeney stole. The team soon believes the next man to return, Clarence Montgomery, a gifted colored cook to the warden's taste, may well have been innocent of the bloody, senseless murder of his white girl friend on a country club golf course. He was the first subject of Dr. Milton Beauregard perverse crime stimulation experiment, but in the present he copycats his own alleged crime. The next returning Alcatraz inmate is Ernest Cobb, a crack-shot who shot series of crows and people in different cities all over he US before being arrested. He deliberately shot a guard in the leg to be relocated to Alcatraz, hell-bent on a quiet, private cell. Warden Edwin James sadistically kept denying him isolation, leading to more inside crimes. Diego 'Doc' Soto's knowledge proves invaluable to catch Cobb before he makes his third victims batches before moving to another time, but the stress and danger of the chase make him doubt if he's fit as SFPD partner. Emerson Hauser remains frustratingly secretive and again seizes the recaptured villain for openly hostile 'interrogation', like Jack Sylvane's despite his claim to ember nothing. Doc and Rebecca close in on a man who may be the key to revealing the secrets behind all the returning criminals. Meanwhile, Hauser makes a discovery beneath the halls of Alcatraz that brings him ever closer to the truth. The next man 'returning' from 1963 and hurting an Alcatraz island ranger is no prisoner but most senior guard Guy Hastings, who was in charge of training recruits. One of those, Ray Archer, seemingly was the pointless butt of convict Tommy Madsen, but actually a loyal relative. Dr. Diego Soto helps Rebecca work out her father-substitutive uncle's more significant position. Meanwhile Guy takes him hostage to look for his elusive heritage, is surprised to see his now adult daughter Annie has kids and grandkids and allows Hauser to bring him into the secret section. 70-fold murderer Johnny McKee returns and reverts to his horrible MO, assuming menial jobs so he can slickly organize terminal toxic tragedy for groups of clients in a bar, a club's swimming pool and even the subway. In Alcatraz, he was forced to collaborate in Dr. Sengupta's 'therapy'. Don and the cops look for clues, also working with the picture among his belongings, of the former belle of the class which includes his first 40 victims after a trauma. The third monster returning from Alcatraz is the most despised yet: threefold convicted child murderer Kit Nelson kidnapped young Dylan Callahan from his bed, terrifying kid brother Liam to silence. Diego 'Doc' Soto realizes his MO is to spend the weekend with him and return the corpse home and breaks emotionally when Emerson Hauser heartlessly sets up a trap there, but finds them himself, although that doesn't go well either. In 1960, Warden Edwin James heaped his cruelty on top of customary abuse by fellow inmates and prison doctor Milton Beauregard. The next reappearing convict is Paxton Petty, a sick Korean war veteran who became a serial landmine murderer. He was tortured in Alcatraz by the brutal doctor and made a deal with Dr. Lucy Banerjee for the whereabouts of the last bomb. Now he wants revenge, especially on Hauser, whom he manages to lure into a minefield. The team must crack the clues in a poem preserved in his prison file. Fifty years ago, Alcatraz prison was closed, all inmates officially shifted to a more modern facility. In fact jailer Emerson Hauser was among those who witnessed dozens of hardened criminals disappearing mysteriously at once. He joined the FBI and heads a secret division to hunt them down now. The first target is Jack Sylvane, dubiously convicted and mistreated, who now exacts bloody revenge on long-retired deputy warden E.B. Tiller. The affair allows recruiting Alcatraz-obsessed genius Dr. Diego Soto and San Fancisco PD detective Rebecca Madsen, who seems somehow destined. Sonny Burnett a man with an incredible dark side who became ultra-violent during his stint at Alcatraz, returns. Next fiends to return are giant Pinky and smart Herman Ames, twin brothers who ruthlessly mounted a rare, nearly successful escape in 1963. Also back is Alcatraz jailer Donovan, their accomplice then, who poses as an island Ranger to trick the team. Doc, Hauser and Rebecca each get in danger while they work out that the three are after a treasure, Civil War gold, which the warden kept locked up. Revealing doors are opened and lives hang in the balance as Rebecca will stop at nothing in pursuit of the man who killed her partner. It takes a while until Hauser recognizes the MO of Webb Porter, who drowns women in their bathtubs at home and auditions as violinist. He suffered from tinnitus since his mother tried to drown him as a young child. Dr. Lucy turned the frightened mental wreck into a self-confident musician. Dr. Milton Beauregard tells Hauser how Webb may save Lucy's life if caught in time, Doc and Madsen help track him down. It was the world's largest concrete building, housing the world's most dangerous criminals. What design strengths made Alcatraz invincible? And what design failures made it a mecca for escape. Uncover the incredible of story of man vs. prison in ALCATRAZ: LIVING HELL. Australia's first television program focusing on dance and electronic music. This late-night show quickly became a cult phenomenon after interviews with Australian artists The Avalanches, Pnau, Infusion, B(ift)ek and internationals Bjork, The Chemical Brothers, Run DMC, Fatboy Slim, Underworld and Carl Cox. The show was a follow-on from the world music and hip hop-focused radio program Alchemy on SBS Radio established by Frank Rodi, but became more interested in the contemporary movements of all electronic music, extending to House, Techno, Drum 'n' Bass with a genuine interest in ambient electronica and IDM. The hour-long, weekly show had an interesting structure being hosted in the studio by three VJ/presenters: Frank Rodi (of SBS Radio), Robbie Buck (then of ABC Radio Triple J) and Nicole Fossati (a music promoter and occasional ABC Radio DJ). The shows had a mix of video clips, music charts and interviews with the artists along with a section titled the 'Scrapbook' which explored a more documentary approach to those with obsessive tendencies in collecting or producing music. Two special hour-long episodes were dedicated to German Electronica and also to the UK artist Aphex Twin. The show took an experimental and exploratory approach to its format, playing with the self-referential (edits were occasionally punctuated with a graphic reading "edit"; text read via a teleprompter was overlaid in mirror over the footage of the presenter reading it; interviews were intercut and remixed into the music played by the artist), many dance floor tracks which did not yet have a video clip had clips produced in-house on a weekly basis and interviews were often held in strange or outrightly stupid locations and environments (David Thrussell was interviewed by Rodi whilst swimming in the infamous overhanging lap pool of the Adelphi Hotel in Melbourne; other interviews were held via security camera, in moving vehicles or shot on a stills camera and re-filmed off a slide projector). This interest in the visual side of music culture extended to being the first music show in Australia to credit the director of the video clip alongside the music producer and record company. Hosted by famous dancer/actor Fred Astaire, this series presented a new drama with each week's episode. Unlike some of the earlier drama series, which tended either toward classics or toward light subject matter, this series often had powerful stories about painful or controversial subjects. Many big names got involved with this series, including actors like Charlton Heston and Lee Marvin, directors like John Ford, and writers like Ray Bradbury.

Produced at the same time as the more well-known Twilight Zone, this series fed the nation's growing interest in paranormal suspense in a different way.

null Alejo and Valentina are a couple that lives in a house in the middle of the forest. They have a lot of adventures, some of them are parodies of popular films and TV series, but are hilarious as well. Alentejo Lawless Land is a short series centered on the political struggle between the conservative and the liberal monarchist factions for the throne of Portugal, in the period of 1828 and 1843. Alentejo, the vast planes south of the Tagus river, poor in agricultural productivity and void of industrial resources, saw the political struggle of the nobles aggravated with the class struggle between the handful of land owners, and the mass of jobless have-nots.

Reign is a 21st century science-fiction retelling of the legend of this Macedonian king. A visual masterpiece, Reign tells the story of Alexander's's triumphs through engaging characters, intricate plots and glorious battle sequences. Alexander is best described as a Flemish tame, low-budget version of classic British sitcom "Some Mothers Do 'Ave 'Em", as Alexander Verdoodt is, like Frank, a clumsy idiot who invariably messes up everything he touches. God knows what his sweet wife, also called Betsy, ever saw in him, everyone one else wisely chooses to keep well-meaning, naive good-for-nothing Alexander at arms length, or rather as far as possible. Eternally unemployed Alexander, whose only 'diploma' is for swimming, is the worst nightmare of Mr. Staes, the clerk in charge of his massive file, and his colleagues in the employment agency.

Did Alexander the Great really build sixteen cities in Afghanistan, or was he the destroyer of a far more ancient civilization? David Adams goes in search of the most alluring of them all - Alexandria on the Oxus. The Ancient Greeks have long been credited for bringing civilization to the East. In fact it appears to be the other way round. Alexander discovered a highly developed civilization - a lost world - that pre-dated even the Persians. As Adams unravels the mysteries of the Oxus Civilizations, its great fortress cities are dramatically recreated in stunning CGI. Traveling through the most remote regions of Afghanistan unarmed, Adams and his Cameraman live as everyday Afghans gaining a most unique insight into the people and our shared heritage. Inspired by the legend of Jason and the Argonauts, ancient Greek seafarers long searched for a way to the East. Adams follows the routes of these past mariners and discovers a lost waterway that could have carried Alexander and his men from the Aegean to the Caspian Sea. Alexander came not just for conquest but for riches, perhaps inspired by the epic quest of Jason and the Argonauts. Adams retraces the route of Alexander and the traders who sought the treasured resources of the East and carried them to every corner of the ancient world. Nearing the end of his journey, Adams reaches the place British explorers called the roof of the world, a land of forgotten tribes and a people known as the children of Alexander. For this final leg, he makes a trek to the headwaters of the Oxus, in the process following pathways that lead back to our earliest beginnings. This closest Flemish equivalent of "Third watch" (but 9 years older) is about the work of a Fire Department in a Belgian town, comprised mainly of volunteers but lead by a professional cadre, the grumpy Adjudant (as in France a rank just under Second Lieutenant) Maurice Haegeman being in daily charge and trying to impose a type of discipline even military professionals wouldn't stomach easily nowadays, under the authority of colonel Walter Halleux who is more concerned with political liaison, budget etc. Naturally the more personal aspects of life in the fire station (bunking, waiting...) and in some cases interwoven private lives also provide story lines, besides the various operations: fire alerts (false and true), kitty in a tree, removing a wasps nest etc. About some kid, Billy Webb, who likes to swap things, and who meets this Italian bloke (Alfonso Bonzo) who likes swapping things.

null Hannibal Heyes and Kid Curry, two of the most wanted outlaws in the history of the West, are popular "with everyone except the railroads and the banks", since "in all the trains and banks they robbed, they never shot anyone". They are offered an amnesty on condition that they stay out of trouble for a year and that they don't tell anyone about it. With a view to keeping their noses clean they adopt the identities of Smith and Jones and use all of their ingenuity keeping out of the way of the law. Heyes and Curry, unable to find work because of an economic depression, accept a rancher's offer of pay plus a fat bonus if they can help herd cattle to a Colorado town. Soon, one of the cattle-drive hands picks a fight with Curry, which ends in a no-decision despite the beating Curry takes. The next morning, the trail boss finds the hand stabbed to death with a stiletto knife. Curry doesn't own one and neither does anyone else on the drive, but because of the fight he's the main suspect. When a second murder in the same fashion occurs when Curry is chained to a wagon wheel for the night, Curry is set loose, but the team is getting extremely edgy because of the murders and because the rancher and the hands lose everything if they don't make the town by the deadline of the title. Curry thinks the two murder victims recognized him from a holdup and maybe confided in their killer, but who might that be? When the cook utters an ill-chosen remark about the rancher's wife (who's traveling with the group and congratulated Curry on holding his own in the fight, a third stiletto murder occurs. The boys must confide in the cook, who then figures out who the murderer is and swears revenge. Curiously, Walter Brennan did this episode as trail cook Gantry in BETWEEN his stints as con artist Silky O'Sullivan that season. Dick Cavett plays the sheriff of Tenstrike, the destination town, in a cameo designed to cross-promote his show and this one, both drawing marginal ratings. The problem with being a notorious outlaw is everyone likes to pin every crime that crops up on you. That includes lying, embezzling, murdering bankers. Which is fine if you're trying to become an infamous legend but a problem if you're hoping for a pardon for your past crimes. So Heyes and Curry have to set things to right. And there's nothing like a diamond field to get a crooked banker into a even bigger mess so he has to confess to avoid a noose. Isn't greed a wonderful thing? The hunt for a lost diamond. The diamond belongs to anyone who possesses it after midnight on July 4, which is when the show starts. Georgette Sinclair also turns up to help in the hunt, but extensive renovations to the hotel make all her efforts (and those of the boys) futile, until Georgette gets extra info and Heyes uses a con game to make sure the diamond stays with them. The first of five episodes to deal with the real-life Wyoming Stockgrower's Association (which led to the Johnson County War of 1892 and inspired the film "Heaven's Gate," which changed many details of the story): two gunmen try to bushwhack Smith and Jones for being in league with "cattle rustlers" -- which in WSGA parlance, applied to anybody who owned fewer than 300 cattle. A small cattle rancher, who has tangled with the gunmen in the past, comes up behind them, surprises them and shoots them down in their tracks. He claims self-defense, but knows people will call it murder (which it is), so asks Smith and Jones to escort him, his wife, his partner and his cattle to Montana where he will be reasonably safe. WSGA "detectives" send out an armed party dedicated to killing the whole lot. When Heyes and the gunman are both critically wounded, Curry goes berserk and blasts away at them until they turn tail. Heyes survives (his comment about being shot in the head later became a tagline for "The Rockford Files"), but the killer dies -- and Curry figures out the truth. Now everyone has a moral dilemma. Heyes is cheated at poker by big, obnoxious Wheelwright. Georgette Sinclair, in the second of three appearances, is hired to help Heyes carry out the title phrase, which Heyes utters while leaving. "Wheelwrong" also cheats George and gives her a literal horselaugh when she tries to bewitch him with a string of pearls. The group goes to Silky O'Sullivan, who lent them the necklace to begin with, and after enduring his rage talk him into lending them money to "ransom" the necklace. Clementine Hale, a friend of our heroes since they grew up together in Kansas, meets the boys in Denver and shows them a group photograph they all posed for not too long ago. The photo is invaluable to lawmen who want to arrest Heyes and Curry, and Clementine waves it at the boys in an attempt to get them to go along with her larcenous scheme. Years earlier, banker Winford Fletcher had stolen $50,000 from the bank where Clementine's father worked, then framed HIM for the theft and sent him up the river. The boys ride into Fletcher's home town and pose as land grabbers, convincing Fletcher to buy up all the land he can get hold of and paying through the nose. This episode was meant to introduce Clementine and Diamond Jim as regular characters, but he didn't appear again and she did only one more show (Sally Field had many other commitments at this point). Blackjack Jenny, an honest middle-aged card dealer, meets our boys in New Mexico and asks them to keep a lookout for her son, who wrote her from the town saying he had a big score of some kind. When the letters stopped, she suspected the big score involved something illegal and that something bad happened to him. Both scenarios are true: the son and a partner, posing as Heyes and Curry, were tricked by a bank executive into posing as Heyes and Curry. When the executive (the banker's son-in-law) was able to figure out the combination to the safe, he then murdered them both. The executive has a girlfriend on the side, a restaurant waitress, whom Heyes and Curry try to charm into getting information on the impostors. Ends with a rather chilling description of vigilante justice as the only solution. Hannibal and the Kid have finally found good jobs in a town where they can really fit in. So why is everyone trying to convince them to get out of town? And more to the point; why are they being so polite about it? And why can't our heroes take some good advice just once? Heyes and The Kid are bushwhacked by a bounty hunter with a high-powered rifle while accompanying Phil Archer and his wife through the desert. Heyes, wounded in the shoulder, and The Kid must distract the would-be assassin so that Archer can attempt an escape to go get help. Archer's attempt to get away fails, leaving it up to Heyes and The Kid to repeatedly distract the marksman while Archer's missus goes for help. Three psychotic thugs -- a man and two women -- hold Curry hostage. The price for his safe return is for Heyes to go through a step-by-step instruction to the man of how to blow up a top-of-the-line bank safe without harming the money inside. Heyes suspects that the thugs will kill him and Curry afterwards anyway, and schemes to trick the group into letting him get the drop on them. Hannibal Heyes (Joshua Smith)and Kid Curry (Thaddius Jones) become enlisted as deputies by the Sheriff of "Big Bend" and are given the job of escorting prisoners to Junction City. They know that the sheriff at Junction City knows who they really are and may cause problems for them. However,a judge may prove to be their only means of staying free from the law. On a journey to Mexico "to drive cattle north of the border" (their real motive isn't revealed until the end of the show), Heyes and Curry meet a Cajun French woman who was shanghaied by a sea captain and only barely managed to escape. They take her to the American woman who owns a casino in San Juan, then set about wooing both ladies -- Heyes faking it for the casino owner; Curry for real with the Frenchwoman, who's a talented singer. While riding from one town to the next the boys answer a man's cry for help and find themselves involved with treasury department agents, counterfeiters, and stolen plates. There's also the matter of a woman who may be the man's daughter or a counterfeiter herself. It will take a Miracle at Santa Marta for Curry to escape a firing squad after a wealthy visitor to a Mexican resort town is murdered. The miracle comes from Heyes visiting and discovering an early case of identity theft, in which two women claim to be the same Kentucky socialite who left home many years ago. The victim recognized the impostor and was killed for it ... but which woman is the impostor? Traveling on a train with the owner of the railroad, Curry accidentally switches bags with the millionaire's secretary. After finding her unmentionables and a Bible (Heyes cracks that the Bible is proof the bags were switched), he also finds $5 million in jewelry. They visit Oscar Harlingen, the millionaire and return the jewels to him, with his thanks. Later, the Harlingen's son Allen (Severn Darden in a dual role; he appears to use a pseudonym for playing Allen) practices appraising the jewels. They look phony to him, so his exasperated father shows him how to evaluate gems. Oops. They really ARE phony. Oscar Harlingen wastes no time gathering up a posse to go after Heyes and Curry. What nobody except the secretary and her boyfriend -- the leader of the posse -- know is that she is the thief, having switched out the jewels earlier. The posse leader uncharitably hires two hit men to assassinate Heyes and Curry once he's found them, and split the jewels with the young woman. When one of the hit men recognizes Heyes and Curry, he refuses to go through with the murder contract and cold-cocks the other gunman. In the ensuing fracas, the posse leader is accidentally killed. The men track down the secretary (Marj Dusay), who claims Oscar Harlingen stole the jewels from her father when they were partners. It's not true. The price for the secretary to stay out of prison is to marry Allen Harlingen, who is sweet on her. A Seinfeldesque "show about nothing" begins with plenty as Heyes, Curry, a doctor, an undertaker and a cowboy see an old man stagger and fall in the street. It takes all of them to lift him because he's carrying more than his weight in gold dust. Thinking he's dying, the old man lets his benefactors work the mine. They all make out like bandits -- until the old man shows up very much alive and orders them off his property, though he'll let them keep what they've taken so far. Heyes and Curry prepare to leave with their cache, only to find out someone else has literally made out like a bandit and stolen it. Then a snowstorm buries the cabin. The old man grudgingly lets the group stay there for the winter (fortunately, he has enough supplies for five extra people). Eager to find out who stole their gold, the boys start a poker game with the other three men. When the doctor, a bad poker player, gives hints that he may be the thief, the boys introduce a variant called "Montana Red Dog," where the doctor keeps betting big on the next card being turned over. Despite the prospector's warning that "Montana Red Dog is a game for suckers," the doctor eventually loses all his chips. But that doesn't conclusively prove that he's the thief, and Curry catches pneumonia in the meantime. Heyes nurses him with the doctor's stethoscope, and thinks of a new use for the device in the meantime. But will that stop the thief? The boys hire on to cut out horses, break them and get them to market before a Big Daddy rancher nearby can claim all the mavericks running the range as his own. In a role reversal of sorts for our heroes, Heyes strikes out miserably talking the talk and playing the cards with a beautiful brunette, while Curry finds a kinship with a very young, very beautiful young blonde lady who is traveling with her very protective older brother. A lovely lady hires Hannibal to help her find her husband who joined the Devil's Hole Gang to escape an errant murder change. At least that's her story, or rather one of her stories. Her supposed husband has a different story. Their relationship turns out to be not so loving and bullets fly, quite literally. Heyes and Curry are among seven people ambushed by outlaws and held hostage in a way station. The leader of the gang, knowing Heyes are Curry are in touch with Sheriff Lom Trevors, politely outlines his plan to assassinate the sheriff when he comes looking for our heroes, in revenge for the death of his brother by Lom (actually, one of his deputies). The gang is prepared to wait a day and a night for Lom, forcing the group to do the same and try to think of ways to warn Lom before he gets bushwhacked. The mercurial leader (Neville Brand) is the biggest threat. The American flag outside the way station plays a key part in the plot. Alias Smith and Jones are hired to recover thousands of dollars in gold dust stashed away by Caroline Rangley and her late husband two years ago, after being attacked by local renegade Indians, in the nearby hills of a one horse town of Apache Springs. Roger Davis, playing alongside his old friend Peter Deuel for the last time (they often competed for roles during the 1960s) turns up as perpetually smiling Danny Bilson, a remarkably fast gun who impresses even Kid Curry. Danny, Curry and Heyes in turn all draw the attention of Seth, a miner who believes he can get at least $20,000 out of a New Mexico mine Seth has -- with the help of three young, strong men. All four agree and work the mine, which lives up to expectations. During a celebration drink-and-dance when they have reached the target figure, Danny plays drunk and waits for the other three to pass out -- then steals the gold and all the food and water. Heyes, Curry and Seth try to walk across the desert. Seth slips away during the night and lies down to die when he thinks he's far enough away -- but Heyes and an extremely angry Curry find his body anyway. Heyes and Curry make it to a creek, refresh themselves and start asking around every town in New Mexico for Danny. When they find him, he is now a wealthy saloon owner with all but $500 tied up in investments. To further make his point, Danny lets a young gunfighter challenges him and drops the young buck in his track. Curry decides to get Danny's goat so badly that Danny will try to back-shoot him, hoping against hope that Danny will miss and Curry can drill him before Danny can fire a second round. That's exactly what happens. This was the first time Ben Murphy (Curry) worked with Roger Davis, but five months after this show filmed in late July 1971, Davis came back permanently as the new Hannibal Heyes. Sarah Henderson ran out on her husband and hooked up with Jim Stokely, a charming drifter. Mr. Henderson wants her back, and has hired Smith and Jones to retrieve her. The boys quickly make friends with Stokely, which both helps and hinders them as they try to persuade Sarah that her alcoholic husband has sobered up and is the man she used to love. Sarah decides to give her husband a second chance, and all seems well -- for one night. Then somebody blows Mr. Henderson's head off with a shotgun. Stokely is the obvious suspect -- too obvious for Heyes and Curry to stomach, having been convinced that the man is no killer. So who did do it? With help with a friendly local sheriff who doesn't recognize them, the boys spread the word that they've stolen the murder weapon and plan to have it tested for fingerprints -- hoping the killer will go after the gun. Features a great final shootout (although both the killer and the sheriff seem to fire when their guns should be empty). Ken Lynch's role as another sheriff helped land him the part of Sgt. Grover on "McCloud" the next season. More bullets than words fly in this episode (or at least it seems that way) when Heyes and Curry board a stagecoach and take a ride to a stop with six other passengers. The stage stop is surrounded by thugs who know Heyes and Curry's identity and want to kill them for the bounty money. When the stationmaster refuses, the outlaws start blazing away while the stationmaster tries to figure out ways to fight back. On a lazy Sunday afternoon, Curry and Heyes (now played by Roger Davis) relax in a gully when a satchel of money literally lands in their laps, thrown from a passing carriage. Heyes opens it and finds $200,000 -- every bill of it a bad counterfeit. Heyes thinks it over for a few seconds and then comes up with a brilliant plan. After shaving off his mustache (Roger Davis had one in real life; after the first day of filming, Universal executives told Davis the mustache looked "sinister" and Roy Huggins wrote the comment into a scene where Heyes shaves), Joshua Smith goes to a bank and asks to put the satchel in a safety-deposit box for the time being. He and Thaddeus Jones are wealthy land buyers, he says, and he wants people to know he has enough money to buy his way into anything. That includes a famous weekly poker game where all the big ranchers join once a week. The banker spreads the word, and Smith is quickly invited to the game, where he soon wins $35,000. But that's when two members of the Devil's Hole Gang (Kyle McMurtry and a masked, non-speaking extra filling in as Wheat Carlson) raid the game and clear the table. That's bad enough, but the banker has also looked inside the safe deposit box and found the money. He threatens to denounce Smith and Jones to the ranchers, and meanwhile the local sheriff has picked up on the name "Wheat" and is looking for the other members of the Devil's Hole Gang, which of course include Heyes and Curry. Our heroes' only chance is for Curry to ride ninety to nothing to Devil's Hole and get the other ranchers' share -- which also equals $200,000 -- back while leaving them the amount Heyes won before the robbery. Then Heyes opens the banker's safe, takes out the counterfeit money and replaces it with the real stuff, which a U.S. Treasury agent verifies. As soon as the Treasury agent leaves, Heyes rushes the $200,000 back to the poker table (minus a $100 bill he dropped and stuck in his pocket), sticks the bad money in the Treasury agent's satchel, and hightails it with Curry to a freight train just before the sheriff figures things out. About two-thirds of this episode was re-shot over four and a half days of filming to replace Pete Deuel's scenes (Davis had to exactly mimic him); a few new scenes include the opening titles and a still picture of Smith and Jones getting off a stagecoach. Ex-slave Joe Sims has a cheerful demeanor that masks intensive hatred for the white racists who have dogged him all his life. He has an uncanny ability to track down Heyes and Curry wherever they go and trap them, planning to turn them in for the reward money and methodically ignoring their pleas that they have reformed. After witnessing some of Sims' confrontations with vicious whites, Heyes and Curry are sympathetic to his plight and try to help him, but Sims won't let them go. After they come into a sizable amount of money, Hannibal Heyes (aka Smith) decides that if he & Kid Curry (aka Jones) are to settle in Mexico, they need their old friend Clementine (Sally Field) to join them. She has to pretend to be married to one of them,to appear respectable. However,she may compromise their stay there when she falls for a suave owner of a bank and also still uses the only photo of Hayes & Curry to get what she wants, or give it to the law. The second and last 90-minute episode (the third show filmed for the second season) finds Heyes visiting wealthy con artist Silky O'Sullivan at his San Francisco mansion -- only to find out that Kid Curry is on trial for murder in Colorado. Heyes rushes to the town and thinks he sees Curry in the dock -- until the real Curry cheerfully waves at him. The man on trial is an impostor; what's more, he never committed the murder he's accused of. Curry loves the idea of "dying" and going off the wanted list, but Heyes reminds him -- and the impostor -- that this will leave Heyes up a certain creek without a paddle. The impostor apologizes but won't back down. Just before the impostor is due to be hanged, Heyes shouts out that Curry's "grandmother" (Silky Sullivan in drag) is coming on the next train to say goodbye. The judge agrees to stay the execution, and soon enough "Grandma Curry" arrives. The disguise is enough to fool the not-too-bright sheriff's deputy in charge of the prisoner, but Heyes grabs for a gun and tries to force the issue. They manage to get the fake Curry out of jail and hide out, but now the whole town is looking for them -- as are members of their old Devil's Hole Gang, who have taken an interest in the affair. Had series finales been a staple in 1972, this would have been it. Heyes and Curry get a telegram from Wyoming sheriff Lom Trevors that the Governor has at long last given them amnesty, and rush to meet the sheriff (Western veteran John Russell takes over from Mike Road, who had played the role in the first two seasons and still voiced it in the opening credits). But the day the amnesty came through is also the day the Governor was removed from office (as a territorial governor, he was appointed by the President -- when the Executive Mansion was occupied by a President of a different party, in this case Grover Cleveland, he appointed one of his own party men to the post). The new Governor, George W. Baxter, is a friend of Trevors and agrees to keep the amnesty on the table, and maybe approve it if the boys will track down his missing daughter. Our heroes succeed, but return to find that Baxter has been removed from office ("Seems he fenced in some Federal land"). Trevors doesn't know the new Governor, Charles Midnight. The last words of the episode are a replay of the words spoken in the pilot (and in the opening credits) about the boys keeping their nose clean until the Governor figures they deserve amnesty. A printed crawl over the last shot records the tumultuous history of the Wyoming Territory governors during the period in question (although buffs will spot several flaws: Governor Midnight's name wasn't Charles -- Roy Huggins may have confused him with famous rancher Charles Goodnight; and the period where the gubernatorial merry-go-round took place was in the infamously deadly-cold and stormy winter of 1886-1887 rather than the summer where filming took place). Decoys, misdirections and deceptions are the order of the day as Hannibal and the Kid get a taste of the other side of the robbery business when they are hired to transport $50,000. To add to the confusion, throw in a very naive, idealistic young woman as a love interest and possible thief. Hannibal has finally met up with a nice girl he can take home to mother. She's refined and proper and, wait a minute, a money hungry gold digger! And wait another minute, Hannibal is working a horse racing con on her. Has Hannibal given up bank robbery for the confidence game? There has to be another story behind this story. Charlie O'Rourke, a friend of Heyes and Curry from their outlaw days, is about to be hanged for a robbery which resulted in several deaths. He recognizes Heyes and Curry from his jail-cell window and offers them a map to the gold bars he stole, wanting that to be his "legacy" to them. The boys decline, but others -- including Bannerman detective Harry Briscoe -- steal the map and head after the gold. In the interests of staying honest and turning the tables on Briscoe, an old foe who might be a friend, the boys start trailing the gold hunters. While evading a posse, the boys run into their old friend, Harry Briscoe (J.D. Cannon in his last appearance on this show), who's been fired by the Bannerman Detective Agency and is now a derelict. They sympathize with him and convince him to use his old credentials to fool the smart sheriff and his dumb deputy by "arresting" them before the posse does. The sheriff lets Briscoe go with Heyes and Curry, but sends the deputy along on the stagecoach to Wyoming. Now to fool the deputy, which is fairly easily done, and to fool the sheriff a second time, which is much harder. Fortunately, they happen upon a pair of bank-robbing killers whom only Briscoe recognizes, and he uses trickery to catch them and get back into the Bannerman Agency's good graces. The ending of this show, as the boys ride through the Utah countryside and chat, was recycled for all subsequent episodes (the boys are filmed in long shot and their dialog was changed for each show). This show and parts of several others were subsequently syndicated under the title "The Long Chase," shown as a TV-movie separate from the series episodes. While playing cards on a train with banker Chester Powers, our heroes are recognized by another banker, Winford Fletcher (the villain of "Dreadful Sorry, Clementine," which had aired nine weeks earlier). Fletcher pulls a gun on the group and says that they cost him a great deal of money to get out of trouble (apparently, he bought his way out of prison time on top of being swindled for $50,000). Powers bluffs Fletcher with a hidden "gun" and Fletcher backs down. That gives Powers an idea. He has speculated with and lost all the securities and bonds in his bank. The cash is still there, but there will be a run on the bank if word of his other losses gets out. So he robs the bank himself and ... you got it ... pins it on Heyes and Curry, giving them a chunk of the money to buy their silence. The boys pretend to accept, but scheme to pit Powers and Fletcher -- who have reached a secret deal to jointly testify against Heyes and Curry -- against each other. They take their share of the stolen money and give it to Fletcher in return for his testimony that they DIDN'T rob the bank when it was knocked over a second time (which is exactly what they do). Now to get Powers and Fletcher, along with U.S. Treasury agents, into the fray with one another ... Two jobs; one dangerous the other, who knows. Two outlaws trying to make an honest living but in need of money. The Kid lost the coin toss, as usual, and is tagged to deliver a wagon load of high explosives to a mining operation. Hannibal gets the job of playing tour guide for a group of archaeologists looking for a long lost tribe of Indians with flaming red hair. Good luck with that. While The Kid faces every life threatening situation imaginable, Hannibal begins to realize that no one on the expedition is what they seem, except, for a change, the lovely, not-so-young lady. And someone has murder in mind. No wonder his job pays more, if only Hannibal can survive to collect it. A wealthy art collector, McCreedy, hires the duo to procure a bust of Caesar that, unfortunately, the current owner doesn't want to part with. Of course he will want it back. But while we're waiting, let's see if McCreedy or Hannibal will out con the other at cards. The title object and the story around it occupies less than a quarter of this episode's screen time. At the beginning, Big Mac MacCreedy hires Smith and Jones to steal it -- again -- from the neighboring Arminderez ranch. Heyes refuses, but agrees to teach one of MacCreedy's men how to do it instead. Heyes and Curry also agree to escort the bust the last half of the way to an auction house, where Big Mac will get rid of it once and for all. While waiting at the assigned spot in a small town, Heyes and Curry confront a town bully -- and keep backing down, to the surprise of an alcoholic ex-clergyman who had completely lost his faith in humanity. But the bully keeps pushing his edge, and Curry starts losing his temper. After this plot thread is concluded (at the end of Act Four) the tag shows the ultimate fate of the bust. Patrick "Big Mac" MacCreedy is tired of years of feuding with the neighboring Amandariz family, whose land abuts his own and is occasionally shaped by the Rio Grande. So he hires Heyes and Curry to try to negotiate a settlement. They put on their game faces and have their hats in hand as they visit the Armaendariz mansion, and get the expected rebuff. But there is a new player in the game -- Armandariz's spinster sister, who is even less friendly than he but who has a deeply religious streak. Heyes and Curry play on that, telling her that MacCreedy is a Catholic widower and piling on the soft soap (some of which is actually true). Carlotta, the sister, decides to investigate MacCreedy herself. There may be a way out of the feud after all. This was the writing debut of Juanita Bartlett for Roy Huggins, who brought her over to "The Rockford Files" a couple of years later; he soon left but she stayed for the whole run and worked extensively with Huggins protï¿½gï¿½' Stephen J. Cannell before starting her own company as a producer. Heyes and Curry are captured by a farm family and brought into Hadleyburg. The farmer wants the bounty money, but has a change of heart and helps them escape. That puts the farmer and his wife into very hot water and make Heyes and Curry very ashamed. Help comes from detective Harry Briscoe, who's investigating a crooked gambling house in another town. Heyes goes to the house and plays blackjack, notices a marked deck at the start of the card game, and gets it replaced with an unmarked deck. He counts the cards in the old sharpie's trick and only making big bets when the deck is near the bottom and he can tell what he's likely to get on the last few hands. Briscoe watches incognito as Heyes wins $32,000. After realizing that Heyes is counting cards, the casino manager orders regular shuffles of the deck, at which time Heyes stops playing and reveals a collection of marked decks that the casino has hidden. Briscoe steps forward and busts the casino owner and dealer. With the money, Heyes and Curry go on a spending spree all over Hadleyburg, making so many civic improvements to the town that it's impossible to field a jury that hasn't been touched by their generosity (smooth lawyer Adam West helps out as well). When Briscoe is called to the stand, he testifies that Heyes and Curry came by the money honestly and are doing all this just to be nice. The judge does not direct an acquittal, rather, the farmer and his wife are pronounced "not guilty" by the jury. Desperate to escape an unusually persistent and smart group of trackers, Heyes and Curry take up with a family and their two tomboyish daughters. The father goes to get supplies while the mother frets about the girls not growing up to be ladies. Which is true: the girls embarrass Curry with their rifle-shooting prowess (he bets them on his pistol prowess and comes out ahead). When the posse DOES capture Heyes and Curry, rifle shots from the girls scare them off. Heyes and Curry soon learn the girls and their mother will go to trial for springing notorious fugitives, and the mother (who didn't know about Heyes and Curry or what the girls did) will take the brunt of the rap. The boys scheme to get the family out of jail. Glen Larson created a new character on "McCloud" after meeting Sidney Clute on the set of this episode, where Clute plays a prosecutor; Clute would play Det. Simms or variations on him for the rest of his life, including a three-year run as La Guardia on "Cagney and Lacey" until his death. In the second half of what later became the TV movie "The Gun and the Nun" (shown on CBS Late Night in the late 1970s and possibly syndicated), Harry Briscoe is on the track of Sister Isabel, nï¿½e Molly, who used to work as a "typewriter" (the name applies to the job as well as the instrument during these early years) in a Kansas City bank. That is, until she allegedly embezzled $30,000 from the cash reserve and took off. Since Molly is Irish Catholic, it was a simple matter for her to join two other sisters looking to establish a mission, posing as having been assigned to them by another convent. Harry isn't fooled by the disguise, but he is also greedy and want to swipe the money and head for Mexico. "Sister Isabel" evades the boys for a while posing as a saloon girl, but Harry eventually catches her and robs her. Our heroes, realizing Harry can be a real friend to them if he's caught and given a lesson on going straight to avoid being shipped to prison, go after him. Judy Carne, Pete Duel's "Love on a Rooftop" co-star, plays one of three Boston spinsters (two young adults and a late-middle-age chaperone; the other two women are buried in the "With" billing) supposedly taking a Wild West tour before returning home. Leslie O'Hara is secretly holding a letter, which Heyes saves from a bandit gang including bumbling Squint (Mills Watson, doing his first Glen Larson show and auditioning for "The Misadventures of Sheriff Lobo"). Leslie wants the letter back and is willing to pay $500 for it, sparking the boys' attention. Leslie springs the boys from jail, which gets a deputy sheriff's attention. Also on the trail is a mysterious, persnickety man from the Federal Government. It turns out everyone is on the trail of money from a bank robbery and the letter is a key. But when we say "everyone," we mean it ... Sorrell "Boss Hogg" Booke has the title role, as a mining-company executive who went from Arizona to Old Mexico to try to settle miners' grievances over unpaid wages, only to be taken hostage in his own right by the miners, who hope to use him as a bargaining chip. A mine supervisor has a particular interest in getting Zulick back to Arizona, but won't explain why. It turns out that Zulick is a lot more valuable than anyone suspected, for reasons that are hidden until nearly the last minute. Another surprise comes when the mine detective turns Heyes and Curry over to the sheriff and then refuses the reward on them in Wyoming, allowing the sheriff to set them free, because he is convinced his debt of gratitude is too great. Ironically, "Bonanza" was also floundering in the ratings in a new time slot against a Norman Lear situation comedy ("All and the Family" was "ASJ"'s nemesis; "Maude" was trouncing "Bonanza"); the two shows would end production and then leave the air less than a week apart. The disappearance of a young heir to a fortune appears to be a kidnapping for ransom orchestrated by Kid Curry as Thaddeus Jones. At least that's what the heir would like to think. In fact he himself is the kidnapper and Curry is his hostage. The kidnapper has his eye on an eligible bachelorette, whom he plans to woo with the ransom money once it gets out of escrow and is paid. Heyes, who comes into town separately, doesn't know all the details but puts together enough to realize Curry is likely to be murdered and his body dumped in a stream until it rots once the ten days are up. So Heyes decides to woo the eligible bachelorette on his own. He meets up with Doc Holliday, whom he knows from a poker game (Holliday was a great winner at faro but not much of a poker player; Heyes had won $20,000 from him in the earlier game, only to have Wyatt Earp force him to lose it back). Heyes points out the young woman and explains that he wants to court her. He's already swiped a book of poetry and memorized it to appeal to her intellectual instincts; now he wants to prove he's a man of means. So, he proposes that he and Holliday play poker together under the woman's eye. Heyes will "win" Holliday's stash (then give it back immediately once they leave the room) and impress the woman with his money. Holliday surprisingly agrees and the plan goes off. But Heyes must still try to track the woman and her treacherous boyfriend to the hideout where Curry is being held hostage. This show could also be called "Alias Frank Canton." An outlaw the boys rode with in Texas got into a little too much hot water, hightailed it north, changed his name and passed himself off as a lawman. As such, he became sheriff of Johnson County and chief enforcer for the Wyoming Stock Growers' Association. "Canton" is willing to tolerate Smith and Jones for a while as long as they don't call him by his real name -- which they have an annoying habit of doing. In "Heaven's Gate," Canton has an even larger role (in fact, he's an association member who hires all the killers) -- and is killed at the end by Jim Averill; in this episode, a title card over a freeze-frame shows that he outlived the Johnson County War by forty years, went back to Texas, begged a pardon from a new governor and became a high-ranking Oklahoma state executive. Mia Bronson, a con artist, has used her ill-gotten money to take over an entire town. Among her victims is newspaper publisher Goerge Austin: she stole all of his advertisers and forced him to sell her the paper for $10,000, half its value. Two of her other victims are Heyes and Curry, whom she cheats with marked decks of cards and has beaten up for complaining. Austin and his daughter find them and nurse them back to health. While recuperating, Heyes and Curry talk to Austin and find out he has been experimenting with the developing chemicals used in photography. He has developed a chemical printing process that will exactly duplicate an image, except that like a photographic negative it is in reverse. The boys come up with a plan. After cleaning up so Mia won't recognize them, they go into town and pass themselves off as counterfeiters who have hired Austin to do their printing for them. They show off two $1000 bills, one real and the other a duplicate. Mia demands more proof, and Austin obliges by duplicating one of Mia's bills. Now if she will just give him twenty more ... To stop the MacCreedy-Armindariz feud from coming to a rope's end, Heyes and Curry ride to the aid of their former employer Patrick "Big Mac" MacCreedy, who is accused of murdering the foreman of his across-the-Rio-Grande neighbor Armindariz's ranch. In fact, MacCreedy only witnessed the shooting and has no idea who the killer is (viewers don't either; the killer is never revealed). While hurrying to help the dying man, MacCreedy saw a neer-do-well drifter (Neville Brand) swipe the man's rifle and take off with it. Heyes and Curry find that the drifter has gone to Tombstone, Arizona -- home to Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday, who both play major roles in the story. They acquire a warrant for the drifter's arrest as a material witness, but it's not an extradition warrant. Thus they need to lure or trick the drifter back to Texas. To do so, they ask a lady friend named Georgette Sinclair who is what would later be called a nightclub singer, meeting her in Tombstone and letting her "woo" the drifter while they watch and play poker. The idea is to get the drifter to fall in love with the singer, agree to go to Colorado with her -- stopping for half a minute in Texas along the way. The last episode to be filmed ("Only Three to a Bed," airing four weeks later, was left over from the Utah trip at the beginning of the season) again delves into "Heaven's Gate" territory, albeit less obviously than other episodes. Members of the Wyoming Stock Growers' Association have lynched two small ranchers they accused of rustling. Sheriff Lom Trevors hires the boys to get the two surviving witnesses out of Wyoming and into Nebraska. The WSGA sends a sheriff after them with extradition warrants as material witnesses, and offers them a fat bribe if they promise to perjure themselves and say they didn't see the accused killers. The lynching was based on the 1889 hangings of Jim Averill and Ella "Cattle Kate" Watson, whom Michael Cimino would resurrect as the leads of "Heaven's Gate" -- set three years later. Desperate to leave a town where the sheriff knows them on sight, Hayes and Curry steal train tickets and board a sold-out train bound for Brimstone. They discover that the men they are impersonating are Bannerman detectives hired to destroy their old gang. Sydney Bristow is a young, athletic, college graduate who was recruited her freshman year as a secret agent for SD-6, a top-secret branch of the CIA. After a few years -- after Sydney confides her lifestyle to her boyfriend, the evil head of SD-6 -- Arvin Sloan, has him killed. Sydney learns that SD-6 is part of a rogue international agency called the Alliance of 12, out to rule the world. She becomes a double agent, working with the real CIA to bring down SD-6 with the assistance of her handler, Michael Vaughn, and her estranged father Jack Bristow -- also a double agent. Along the way, Sydney fights various rival agents, rival terrorist groups, and traitors all the while keeping her cloak-and-dagger lifestyle a secret from her friends. (Season 1) Four months after Vaughn's murder by the traitorous Gordon Dean and his associate Ivan Curtis, a grief-stricken Sydney teams up with Renï¿½e Rienne, a French freelance assassin and fugitive on the CIA's most wanted list who knew Vaughn from their past association with Prophet Five, to ask for leads in order to track down the killers before they can strike again.

Future television veteran Mike Wallace, together with his real-life wife, Buff Cobb, travel to various locations all around New York City. Whether at formal social events or casual family spots, the couple would strike up conversations and conduct interviews with their hosts and with the people they happened to meet around them. A group of friends begins to notice that elements of their lives are different from what they believe they ought to be. Their investigation into these strange phenomena reveals that something very unusual has happened to them. While attempting to uncover the mystery they discuss some of the most fundamental questions of the universe and the human mind. James Herriot is a vet in Yorkshire, England, during the 1940's. He is assigned to the practice of Siegfried Farnon, who (together with his mischievous brother Tristan) already have a successful business. James undergoes a variety of adventures during his work, which are just as often caused by the characters of the county (including the Farnon brothers) as the animals in his care. Siegfried takes Calum to task for wasting medical supplies. Of course, he doesn't quite live by his own rules. He also treats a flock of sick turkeys whose owner is convinced the vets are out to cheat him of his hard earned brass. Zoe Bennett and Helen take in lunch at the country club where Helen learns that Granville Bennett is looking for a partner in his small animal practice. Helen is attracted by the financial security this could provide them and gets James to thinking about the possibilities. When he visits Granville with a seriously injured cat, James starts to seriously consider the possibility. Tristan is having difficulty keeping up with his tennis-playing girlfriend. The war is finally over and James returns to Darrowby to rejoin his partners, Siegfried and Tristan Farnon, in veterinary practice. James is having difficulty re-adjusting to civilian life however. His first call is to Mr. Biggins, who is the same old self and does nothing but complain about the vet's service. Relations are also strained with Helen: James is short-tempered with little Jimmy and can't seem to open up to her about his feelings. Mrs. Hall has passed on and Siegfried hires a new housekeeper, Mrs. Hubbard, whose culinary skills turn out to be somewhat lacking. Tristan, older but not necessarily wiser, is back with the bell ringers. Siegfried meets an old flame, Caroline, who returns to Darrowby after living in America. Several years have passed since the 1983 special. Sister Rose calls James to rescue an abandoned dog trapped in a bog, who turns out to have a serious illness. Tristan appears in Darrowby escorting Debbie Mount to church. Mr. Mount is impressed with Tristan's improved character but the Herriots are skeptical. James says he wants to build a tennis court in the garden. Rosie decides she would like to be a vet and accompanies her dad on his rounds, but James seems less than enthusiastic at the prospect. He's doesn't think a large-animal practice is suitable for women and sets about showing Rosie the less appealing side of a being a country vet. Siegfried loses a patient when a cat in his care decides to hitch a ride in traveling salesman's van. Helen returns to Skeldale House still somewhat blue from the death of her Aunt and hoping to spend some time alone with James. Their attempt to find that quiet time meets with little success however. James is faced with a difficult calf birth that not only exhausts him but keeps him out all night. After Sigfried admonishes him for working too hard - as usual, it's thank to Sigfried as much as anyone that he's been so busy - James and Helen plan an afternoon out. As their run of bad luck would have it, James finds himself treating a badly injured dog. Tristan also lets him down but James has a very enjoyable way of getting back at him. The vets visit a modern dairy farm and are left to wonder who benefits from the cold efficiency. Miss Westerman returns with her dog Hamish; Tristan tries to avoid her, given that he misplaced Hamish the last time she put him in the vets' care. She is concerned at the rumors that all dogs will need to be destroyed if war is declared, but Tristan sets her mind to rest. The vets agree to spay a cat for a minimum fee, but find they may have gotten more that they bargained for. Siegfried treats Herbie Hinchcliffe's aging horse Dolly and becomes emotionally involved in the case when he has to put her down. James and Siegfried have to deal with the Shadwells whose cattle are seriously ill. Bill Shadwell will soon be retiring and apparently refuses to face facts and the whole situation is causing considerable friction in the Shadwell family. Siegfried has to convince Mr. Grimsdale that his bull requires a operation. Unfortunately, Grimsdale is as concerned about his money as he is about the bull. Tristan is having fun with his latest toy - a cumbersome army surplus metal detector. Siegfried treats Captain Crawford's sick horse. The Captain is a newcomer to Darrowby along with his apparently surly son, Hugh. James treats Arnie Braithwaite's dog, who may have diabetes. Dennis Pratt is seriously behind in paying his bills and the vets decide to have another go at him in the hope of getting something on account. Siegfried pays a call on the Hardwickes and again finds himself unable to get home - this time, he seems to have lost his car keys. James and Siegfried treat a badly injured dog. Helen is packing for the move to their new house and expresses concern when James and Calum must visit Granville Bennett with a sick dog requiring an urgent operation. James confidently assures her that she has nothing to worry about. With the operation complete, Granville suggests they attend a veterinary lecture at a nearby village. To no one's surprise, Granville's main interest seems to be in the buffet dinner and open bar and both James and Calum return home somewhat the worse for wear. While he is away, James' pet dog Dan has a heart attack and James may have a difficult decision to make. A busy time for Calum. He must perform a minor operation on "Puppy" but James' advice on administering the sedative doesn't seem to quite work. He also needs to operate on a sick cow, but has some difficulty keeping the owners focused on the task at hand. Calum also receives a visit from Molly McFeely, with whose family he stayed with while in Ireland - and Deirdre decides to visit at the same time. James meanwhile receives an invitation to examine Lord Buttermere's new stallion. James is unhappy when Siegfried acquires a second car while he has to put up with his aging heap. Siegfried has a surprise for him however. James treats a dog who has a broken leg which has yet to knit after six weeks in plaster. James is aghast when he's asked to judge the dog competition at the Darrowby Show. Mrs. Pumphrey subsequently informs him that she plans on entering Tricki Woo. Siegfried visits a farmer who has installed a modern milking parlor. He's dismayed however when he diagnoses the possibility of hoof and mouth disease and has to make a report to the Ministry of Agriculture. Calum treats Herman, a dachshund who has developed difficulty walking. Tristan and Siegfried have to treat Clancy, Mr. Mulligan's very large dog who is "womittin" again. Mrs. Hall advises James to get on with it vis-a-vis Helen and warns him that he risks losing her, with Richard Edmundson around. James however thinks Helen's father doesn't think much of him and that overall, he's a very poor catch. Siegfried and Tristan are also concerned that James is too slow getting off the mark and decide to do something about it. James finally pops the question, but shudders at the thought of having to ask Mr. Alderson's permission. Mr. Biggins entertains the lads at the Rovers, courtesy of Tristan. Mrs. Dalby is worried about her herd of cattle and James can't come up with a diagnosis. Much is happening in the practice. Helen is bedridden due to a bad back. Calum, much to his chagrin, is dispatched to Ireland for several weeks to undertake tuberculin testing. During a fierce winter storm, James tries desperately to reach a farmer in need. Tristan announced that he has resigned from the Ministry of Agriculture to join the practice full-time: but are Siegfried and James prepared to take him on? The Darrowby Bell Ringing Society is suspending its operations for the duration of the war and they have one, final "meeting" at the local pub. James and Tristan go to the bell tower with not unexpected results. The vets have to deal with a series of dog poisonings. They soon identify the farmer responsible, but not before several more animals die. Siegfried treats Joan Clifford's dog Saxon, but the case has very specific implications for her. James treats Mr. Hanson's pigs but it's Mr. Hanson who is most entertaining in that he always speaks at the top of his lungs. Siegfried and Tristan treat Mr. Benson's flock of sheep, most of whom are suffering from a severe calcium deficiency but several have been killed by a dog. Siegfried also has to make a late-night all to Harold Ingledew who, in his cups, is something less than efficient. James is still confined to the surgery because of a sore ankle. He meets Roderick Perowne, whose dog has been injured and Peter Marsten whose dog Jack may have gotten involved in a bit of serious mischief. Marsten is devastated when James determines that Jack may be responsible for the sheep attacks. Tristan is named the Ministry of Agriculture's sterility adviser for the north riding of the county. As such, he's responsible for promoting the use of artificial insemination to some very doubtful farmers. James acquires a new record player, but is reluctant to let anyone else use it. Rosie accompanies James on his rounds, but nearly has a serious accident. Calum takes up residence in Skeldale House. Tristan is assigned to examine a flock of sheep being exported to the Soviet Union so he and James head off to the docks in Hull. The possibility of war is on everyone's mind with Helen preparing for the privations ahead and Tristan tasked to tape the windows in the event of bombing. Siegfried decides that they should conserve food and heating by eating their meals together, but Mrs. Hall takes his instructions to economize a bit too seriously. James treats Hamish, a sick dog who requires an operation and Tristan, who is tasked with overseeing his recovery, loses him. The vets forgo a posh evening out to treat a stray dog who has had an accident. Tristan is aghast at Siegfried's attempt to pair him with Deirdre Headingley, one of his crony's less-than-attractive daughters. Siegfried once again gets James to play cricket in a charity match for the village against the county team. The tables are turned however when James is injured and Siegfried is pressed into service. Bob and Rachel Taylor are worried about their lame horse, Maggie. Siegfried operated on the animal, but she seems to going down hill. Siegfried is accompanied oh his rounds by young Colin Appleby, who has sick goldfish. England is at war and the time has come for James and Siegfried to join their military units. Their last day at the practice is a busy one and James is repeatedly called out when he had hopes to spend a last, quiet evening at home with Helen. Siegfried surprises James with a small gift. Mrs. Hall also has a surprise announcement for everyone and Tristan receives shocking news from the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons. With Calum now in Nova Scotia and Tristan away, Siegfried arranges for Willie Bannister to assist them for a period of time. Once again, Willie has a very pretty new girlfriend, Glenys, but their pub lunch doesn't quite go as planned. James is called out to examine a dead rabbit and meets the Strong brothers who are obviously feuding and reportedly haven't spoken for nearly fifty years. Turns out Roland Strong is putting something quite special on his cabbages and this may be the cause of the problem. Mr. Hartley ropes Siegfried into speaking to a local farmers group. Having accepted, Siegfried tries desperately to get out of it. It's a bad time for the vets and a local farmer when they discover a case of foot and mouth disease. The farmer's stock must be destroyed and a general quarantine is in place for thirty days. Siegfried, who came into contact with the animals confines himself to Skeldale house, meaning James and Tristan must do all of the outside calls. James discovers the power of anesthesia in assisting animals to heal: first with a farmer's dying ewe and then with the Flaxton's pet poodle. Siegfried has become a bit horse shy given his recent experience with Dolly. James has to deal with the very unpleasant Ralph Beamish, an arrogant horse owner who continually ignores his advice. Siegfried visits a local pig farmer and fears his animals may be infected with foot and mouth disease. Mrs. Beck continues to complain about her with the vets bill and is now worried about how her cat might survive a gas attack should war be declared. Germany has invaded Poland and the British government has given Germany an ultimatum to leave or they will be at war. Christmas 1955 is fast approaching but the vets are dealing with their usual assortment of diseased animals and entertaining locals. James is particularly proud of Frank Gillard's farm. Gillard also keeps racing pigeons and Mr. Biggins accuse the birds of importing hoof and mouth disease. When Gillard's cattle develop the dreaded disease, he has no choice but to destroy his herd. Tristan buys himself a fancy Daimler coupe but then can't quite pay back the money he borrowed from Sigfried who gives him until Christmas day to settle up or he will take possession of the car. Tristan once again joins the bell ringers but more because he's interested in Miss Marston, the new teacher who is also a member of the group. James and Sigfried find themselves acting as references in court for the feuding Bradley brothers, David and Jonathan, who have been fighting since the death of their fire some years before. James works with young, hard-working farmer Frank Metcalfe, who has relocated from the city. Unfortunately his herd is diagnosed with brucellosis, which has both immediate and long-term effects. Tristan returns from school and admits to James that his exams may not have gone all that well. He also meets Richard Carmody, a brilliant veterinary student who is spending a few weeks with the practice to gain practical experience. Tristan takes a dislike to him and he and James look for an opportunity to teach him what it's really like to work in a country practice. Finally, the vets and the village doctor see an opportunity to teach Gobber Newhouse, a local bully and wife-beater, a lesson when he steps on a rusty nail and needs care. James continues to pine for Helen and learns he has a rival for her affections in the form of Richard Edmundson, a wealthy member of the local gentry. Tristan suggests James may want to join the local musical society - especially since Helen is a regular attendee. Tristan has another all-nighter with the bell ringers, leading Siegfried to believe he has too much time on his hands. So he puts him in charge of some newly acquired piglets. Mrs. Pumphrey also acquires a new pet pig, Nugent, and she asks Uncle Herriot to examine him. Siegfried reaches the breaking point with Miss Harbottle. Tristan comes up with a perfect way to look busy whenever Siegfried appears. Siegfried wants James and Helen to have a flat at the top of the house instead of their cramped room. The vets can't manage to give an injection to Boris, a puma masquerading as a domestic cat. Siegfried bumps into Mr. Beresford, the manager of the local bank whose dog behaves badly in the car. Tristan woos the lovely Marjorie Simpson and Siegfried meets Sarah Raworth. James treats the elderly Mr. Bailey's dog who has developed a bad case of bronchitis and Siegfried criticizes James when he waives the fee. Siegfried, however, has trouble following his own advice. Tristan rescues a severely injured cat and then convinces James to treat him rather than put him down. Helen promptly adopts him and nurses him back to good health but is devastated when she learns the cat belongs to the Gibbons family. Everyone celebrates Tristan's birthday. Siegfried goes on the warpath as a result of the number of farmers not paying their bills - in one case, no payment for three years! They draw up a black list of the worst offenders and decide to tackle the issue head on. But Siegfried doesn't worry when rumors have Major Bullen being bankrupt - as he is a gentleman, Siegfried is quite sure the Major will pay up. James once again has to deal with Mr. Biggins, who is constantly worried about paying too much for veterinary services. Calum returns from Ireland and is thrilled to hear that Deirdre will be spending a week in Darrowby; unfortunately, the week doesn't quite go as planned. Siegfried treats a horse after it suffers a serious fall and James is introduced to a family of cat lovers. Tristan meanwhile treats a dog who seems to take great joy in biting him. He subsequently learns that he must go to Ireland for the next month to continue the tuberculin testing. James' friend from school, Andrew Bruce, visits Darrowby for a few days. Andrew is a London banker who loves the Dales and is thinking of relocating to Darrowby. He accompanies James on his rounds and their first stop is at the Hugills, a farm run by four eccentric, middle-aged brothers. Siegfried visits Mr. Dumbleby, a demanding farmer who rarely pays his bills. James is still considering buying into a partnership with Granville Bennett and Helen in particular seems to be quite keen. James is on pins and needles awaiting the results of the postmortem on Lord Hulton's horse. He continues to make his rounds, becoming acquainted with some of the local remedies for sick cattle. Siegfried's younger brother Tristan returns to Darrowby from veterinary college having once again failed his exams. Siegfried assigns him to collecting payments on market day, but where has he put the receipt book? James is also introduced to Mrs Pumphrey and her pekingese, Tricki Woo, who then sends Uncle Herriot a gift. Mr. Biggins tells James about his cowhand, Ned Finch, who goes drinking every night and is drawn to the bright lights of the big city. All James ever sees is an amiable fellow having a quiet drink in his local pub. Mrs. Hall is all aflutter with the visit of Mr. Barge, the loquacious pharmaceutical representative. Mrs.Pumphrey is worried when her new boxer, Cedric, proves to be overly flatulent. James finds a perfect solution. Mr. Beresford's dog is still misbehaving in the car. Siegfried suggest a new sedative, but it unfortunately doesn't have the desired impact. Helen, James, Tristan and Siegfried have a wonderful lunch at swank French restaurant where Tristan meets Julia Tavener. He becomes desperate to meet her and sees his chance when James is called out to treat the Tavener's dog. Mrs. Pumphrey visits the surgery with Tricki Woo and also offers Tristan help and advice on his pursuit of Julia. Not surprisingly, their date doesn't quite go as planned but Tristan suddenly feels trapped by her constant attention. James visits the Bellerbys to treat a sick cow and he agrees to give them a lift to the village as they are all attending a performance of Handel's Messiah. James becomes a bit concerned however when the family's lunch seems to drag on and on and the time for the performance grows ever nearer. James also has to treat Tim Alton's prize pig who has gone off her feed. He also faces a dilemma when Mrs. Tompkins budgie dies in his care. His solution presents unanticipated results. Tristan treats Albert Skerry's bloated cow by releasing some of its stomach gas. Unfortunately, as he does so, Mr. Skerry strikes a match with the expected results. The humour of it all is lost on Siegfried when he receives a solicitor's letter requesting compensation. Ewan Ross, a nearby vet, asks for some help and Siegfried suggests James go out and give him a hand. Ross is a formidable character who is not only one of the best horse vets around, but is also reputed to be overly fond of drink. Siegfried gets the idea that they should raise guinea fowl; pandemonium ensues when Tristan forgets to close the gate. Siegfried gets a visit from his old friend, Stewie Brannan, who is on his way home after attending a conference in London. Stewie is in a bit of a pickle, however as it seems that while at the conference, he drunkenly invited the renowned Professor Norton to dinner. The Professor accepted and now Stewie turns to Siegfried for assistance in hosting the dinner. Bernard Wain is a farmer who is sensitive to bad odors and he has taken up James' suggestion of wearing a handkerchief over his nose when required. This leads to a interesting encounter with the local constabulary. Helen plans a special dinner for their wedding anniversary but James has apparently forgotten all about the important date. James and Helen are proud parents when Jimmy is asked to play in his piano teacher's music recital. James becomes fed up when his car breaks down and it may tip his decision on whether to accept the partnership offer from Granville Bennett. The time has come again for Kit Bilton to slaughter his pig. As usual, he has become so fond of the animal that he can hardly bear it and begs Tristan not to do the deed. Siegfried visits the Hardwicke family who seem to do everything as a pack. Calum is supposed to collect Deirdre at the train station but finds himself literally up a tree when he's charged by a bull. James offers his condolences to Mrs. Dalby whose husband recently died. He's a bit doubtful when she tells him that she'll be running the farm on her own. Things go from bad to worse when some newly acquired cows fall ill. Helen stops by the surgery and invites James to tea on Sunday. James gladly accepts and things are going well until one of Mr. Alderson's cows falls ill and James is unable to save it. Helen and James manage to overcome their bad luck however. Tristan finally gets a car to use but accidentally releases the parking brake; the car goes roaring downhill and straight into the new golf course clubhouse. Gobber Newhouse convinces Jim to have a drink with the lads, only to also present him with the bill. Siegfried takes Tristan to task when the bus in which he was a passenger hits and kills one of Lord Brawton's stags. Tristan wasn't driving, but Siegfried feels he should have done more to report the accident. Soon after, venison is available on the market. Tristan and Calum are still vying for Deirdre's affection, but Tristan seems to be making little headway despite his attempts to appreciate all things Scottish. James treats Tricky Woo who, according to Mrs. Pumphrey, is going completely cracker dog. Siegfried treats Mrs. Westby's dog, who is suffering from a severe bout of pneumonia. Calum comes up with a solution. Tristan and Siegfried meet Roddy, a hobo and his dog who are passing through the area. Mrs. Hall needs to visit sick relatives for a few days and Tristan is assigned chief cook and bottle washer. He also has to do the spring cleaning, cook the meals and put in his time in the surgery. Siegfried is less than sympathetic when Tristan complains. Granville Bennett stops in wanting the vets to care for his dog, Phoebe, who needs an minor operation. He invites James and Siegfried to lunch the next day and James once again over imbibes. Helen practices her first aid skills on James. Tristan is back from helping Stewie Brannon with his practice and is once again in love, this time with Mrs. Pumphrey's attractive niece Angela Mortimer. Angela is best described as morose, never smiling and terribly unhappy owing to a recent broken engagement. He invites her to go on a picnic and then accompany him on a call. Her reaction to a mishap puts him off. Sigfried's family is away and so moves into Skeldale House temporarily. Unfortunately, he also has a broken bone in his foot and Mrs. Alton has him on rations of chicken soup. Mrs. Pumphrey gets James to be the judge at the local vegetable show with unexpected results. With their families away in London for a week, Siegfried suggests that he and James move into Skeldale House. Siegfried has visions of re-living those glorious days, now past, where he and James would spend long evenings talking about everything under the sun. On the first evening, they realize they don't have much to talk about. Their presence also interferes with Calum and Deirdre's private time together. James also meets Basil, now working as a cowman for a local farmer but who seems to have taken up a wide variety of jobs in his life; he's also less than reliable as it turns out. Mrs. Hall is away visiting a cousin and James agrees to fill in for Stewie Brannon while he's on holidays. Siegfried and Tristan make the best of it but Tristan's culinary skills have not improved over the years. He does make an excellent bangers and mash, for every meal, everyday. James treats a severely injured dog and has a bit of difficulty with the local dialect. James Herriot, a newly qualified vet, arrives in the village of Darrowby for a job interview with Siegfried Farnon. Things get off to an inauspicious start when it seems that Siegfried is away for the afternoon and his housekeeper, Mrs. Hall, knows nothing of his visit. Siegfried eventually arrives, full of apologies for having forgotten and they set off on a series of calls. James gets to try his hand at treating a lame horse and a cow suffering from mastitis and to his great pleasure, is offered the job. In his first full day on the job however, James is called out to Lord Hulton's farm treat one of his best horses. James' diagnosis is twisted bowel and the horse is put down. The farm manager, Soames, swears he'll sue if the post-mortem shows James to be incorrect. Tristan takes a sudden interest in the local choir - or more specifically, one of the choir members, Jane Mercer. When she takes an interest in a donkey that is ill-fed, Tristan goes well beyond the call of duty to support her. A visit from Granville Bennett with a sick dog, Persephone, is a pleasure for everyone in the practice. When James finds out that he is to be on his own with Granville for an evening at the pub however, he redoubles his resolve to not over-imbibe. Biggins is still up to his old antics getting the vets out to his farm at all hours but not being very quick when it comes time to pay. His latest concern seems to be the stray cat who hangs around his barn. Tristan has had a rather late night and Siegfried takes him to task over his bad habits. Tristan announces that he has a steady girlfriend, Deborah Mount and will reform his wild ways. Turns out Deborah's father doesn't know anything about the relationship and may not approve. When he does hear of it, he has serious doubts about Tristan's character. Tristan doesn't help his case with his silly pranks. James has several encounters with a street urchin, Wesley Binks, whom he'd earlier caught stealing. James nonetheless helps Wesley out when his dog contracts distemper. Siegfried reacts badly when the Weeting brothers tell him they are off to join the military. Roddy Travers, a one-time resident of Darrowby, returns to the village. Roddy is an itinerant handyman and many, including Siegfried are happy to see him back. Unfortunately, a rash of petty thefts coincides with his return and he immediately falls under suspicion. James helps Sam Witchell whose sheep are being attacked and who suspects Roddy's dog, Murphy. Turns out there is a thief, but its more of the four-legged variety. As for the dead sheep, the true culprit is finally identified, and just in time. James visits the Alderson farm to treat a calf with a broken leg and meets the very attractive Helen Alderson for the first time. Meanwhile, Siegfried decides to bring to some business-like discipline to the practice by hiring a secretary, Miss Harbottle. Not surprisingly, she turns out to something more than he expected! Mrs. Bond visits the surgery with her cat Boris "the Gladiator" and James is left with visible reminders of the encounter. To Helen's dismay James has agreed to be the official vet at the Darrowby and Houlton Show. He innocently believes that it will just another pleasant day out, but it turns out to be quite a busy day day including cheaters and some trying to enter sick animals. His biggest challenge is in judging the family pets, where Mrs. Pumphrey has entered Tricki Woo. Tristan tries to woo a pretty barmaid in the beer tent and Mrs. Hall enters her preserves in competition against the perennial winner. James tries his hand at carpentry, hoping to build a birthday present for Helen. Things aren't working out quite as planned however so he seeks advice from a local cabinet-maker. Tristan accidentally injects newlywed Nat Briggs with an abortion serum and the farmer is now convinced that he will never father any children. Siegfried is convinced that something is seriously wrong with Tristan when he suddenly stops going to the Drovers. . James treats Paul Cotterell's dog Theo, who has been losing weight and is diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease. James recommends that Theo be put down and Paul agrees. James doesn't realize the impact this has on Paul and the tragic results that ensue. James meets Lord Hulton, a hard working farm owner despite his aristocratic background. Hulton takes a liking to a horse that has wandered onto his property from the nearby military depot. At the Billings farm, James finds young calves who are wasting away. He thinks they have ingested an irritant of some kind, but the vets simply can't isolate it. Siegfried becomes annoyed with Jenny Garston and David Rayner who are constantly bickering, usually about horses. Both have mares in foal and are convinced they know more about horses than the other. It's all the more complicated because his nephew is married to her daughter and they will soon have a child. Siegfried and James have a quiet pint of ale (during off hours) with Reg, the owner of the Black Horse, just when PC Gould decides to see exactly what is happening. The vets have think on their feet to make things right. James and Siegfried treat a gypsy family's ailing donkey. It's Christmas-time and Siegfried gets to visit the Hewison farm and a chance to taste Mrs. Hewison's Christmas cake, the best in the district. Only she has a surprise for him this year. Tristan wonders if uncle Herriot has any plans to visit Mrs. Pumphrey, in the hopes of getting another hamper from Fortnum and Mason's. When Tricki Woo falls ill, James decides that the dog needs to spend a few days at Skeldale House. Siegfried mysteriously keeps the front room locked, only to arrange a surprise for a very nosy Tristan. Helen visits the surgery with her dog Dan, but James is embarrassed by his performance when he last saw her at the dance. He nonetheless manages to ask her out to the movies, but once again, their date is a bit of a disaster. The film he thought they were to see has been replaced by a cheap western and Gobber Newhouse, in his cups, provides a bit of unexpected entertainment. Tristan reads with interest in the local newspaper that there may be a historical basis for the ghost that haunts Raines Abbey, given that several monks were killed there several centuries ago. Sure enough, the ghost soon makes another appearance. James has to deal with a farmer who insists his cow was struck by lightning and wants James to provide the necessary documentation to support an insurance claim. Siegfried lectures James and Tristan on their forgetting equipment during their farm visits; of course, Siegfried needs to listen to his own advice. Siegfried's university friend, Henry Clintock, moves to the area and Siegfried tries to arrange for Ewan Ross, whose veterinary practice is still in decline, to be his regular vet. James and Siegfried agree to care for Tricki Woo when Mrs. Pumphrey is away to France. James panics however when Tricki disappears. James provides advice to a young farmer on the purchase of a flock of sheep. Siegfried decides the time has come to hire a full-time assistant and he thinks he has the perfect candidate in Calum Buchanan. Tristan is now a full-time employee of the Ministry of Agriculture where he sets his sights on the attractive Deirdre McEwan. Mrs. Pumphrey needs uncle Herriot's help when Tricki Woo goes 'flop bot', yet again. James is invited to join the local milk subcommittee, but is concerned as to whether he can afford it. Siegfried has difficulties with a colleague, Mottram, who is convinced that Siegfried is poaching his clients. James has another encounter with Mr. Biggins, who is convinced the vets are just out to take his money. When his cow dies, he suggests it's James' fault. The vets also meet Jip, a sheep herding dog who has never barked. Siegfried accuses Calum of pandering to panicky clients when he tells them to call the vets anytime, day or night. Tristan assists Mrs. Derrick who wants advice on raising goats. When she tells him her husband is retired, Tristan's picture of an elderly gentleman with a pretty young wife proves to be only half accurate. Calum meets the Duke of Mannerton who has an interesting proposition for him. Helen takes a liking to a stray cat and her kitten when they stray into the garden. Having finally worked up the courage to ask Helen out on a date, James is not quite sure where to take her. Tristan convinces him that the first date is always the most important so he recommends that James take her to dinner at the Reniston, the poshest hotel outside of London. To his chagrin, James follows Tristan's advice and the date isn't very successful. To make matters worse, Tristan subsequently gets James to complete a foursome with two lively lasses and they meet Helen and Richard Edmundson in less than ideal circumstances. Tristan is less than enthused at having to care for the pigs Siegfried has acquired. James treats an itinerant family's sick horse. The vets seek the assistance of Sister Rose in finding a home for a stray dog. Everyone in Darrowby is preparing for the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. Tristan has taken himself off to London to take in the event live. Rosie is to play a princess in the school pageant but has come down with the flu and Jimmy, who is to play the Archbishop, thinks his cloak makes him look like a sissy. James has to treat Wolfie, a dog who appears to live up to his name. Thieves are taking advantage of some of the elderly residents of Darrowby. Siegfried tries his hand at a herbal remedy to treat a sick sheep. James and Helen are about to celebrate their first wedding anniversary and Tristan suggests to James that they go to the Harlequin, a modest restaurant that opened recently. It turns out to be anything but and is in fact one of the poshest restaurants in the area. Siegfried starts seeing Margery Egerton. Tristan, now a free man since being forbidden to see Miss Mount, sets his sights on previous conquests. Siegfried and Tristan ask James to arbitrate when they both want the same evening off. James has to pay several visits to Mr. Bailes whose dog seems to take great delight in scaring the wits out of him. Mrs. Pumphrey consults James and Siefried on the use of music as a means of relaxing Tricky Woo. She then throws a birthday party and surprises uncle Herriot with a special request. In the end, she is astonished to find that Tricky Woo has very specific tastes in music! James is busy with tuberculin testing but is summoned to the Ministry of Agriculture when the test results don't quite add up. Siegfried has to deal with a dog owner who only believes in strict discipline in dealing with his dog. He also has to deal with dying sheep, but the owners may not have the means to save them. Helen gets a job as a secretary, but James isn't quite sure he approves. Siegfried, on the other hand, thinks it's a wonderful idea. Tristan is less than enthused however when he realizes he will have to take over Helen's duties in the partnership. Mrs.Hall tells Siegfried that she has to leave to help her brother, who is now alone to work his farm. Tristan finally gets the bad news he's been expecting: he's failed his final exams and must now tell Siegfried. He decides to soften up Siegfried a bit starting an exercise program and cutting out drinking and smoking. James has to deal with Mrs. Donovan, a self-styled animal healer whose dog is killed in an accident. When he's called in by the local constable to deal with a case of animal cruelty, he knows just who to call on to find it a home. Finally, James must assist cranky Angus Grier, a neighbouring vet who has a broken arm. James calls on Mr. Partridge who has a sick dog, Percy. James suggests that Percy undergo medical treatment rather than surgery but the medication has an unusual side effect. James notices that Mr. Partridge is a gifted amateur painter and arranges for him to paint a portrait of Bill Ogilvie's new prize bull. Partridge is amazed at the fee James has negotiated for him and gets to work but Ogilvie grows less enthusiastic when his bull is apparently uninterested in performing his "duties". James treats Mr. Rudd newly acquired cow, Strawberry, with amusing results. Tristan treats Angela Farmer's dog but he accidentally injects her instead of the dog. Tristan is upset when Siegfried criticizes him for sleeping in. Siegfried assumed Tristan was out partying when in fact he had spent most of the night treating a sick cow. Tristan is convinced that Siegfried and James are always giving him the dirty jobs, so he and Siegfried swap rounds for the day. Tristan first call is to treat Mr. Sutcliffe's rather large pig. Siegfried has to deal with Mrs. Clarke, whose lambs are failing. Turns out her own health may not be what it once was. James advises Franco Pedretti, who is hoping to marry but doesn't quite know how to propose, on local customs. James and Tristan drive back from a conference in London and Tristan promptly drives the car through the garage wall. Tristan gets a visit from a Edinburgh friend, Alice McTavish, who has 'wee Tristan' in tow. There's a simple explanation but Siegfried jumps to conclusions. Tristan is obviously very keen on Alice and starts thinking about more permanent arrangements. James treats the Barratts' dog; they are clearly an unhappy couple on the verge of a separation. The vets must deal with Kit Bilton, an amiable local farmer who every year fattens a pig for slaughter. Problem is that Kit becomes so fond of the animals that he's an emotional wreck when the times comes to do the deed. Helen is away taking care of a sick aunt and Tristan tries to convince James to go on pub crawl. Siegfried seems to hit it off with Tristan's friend, Daphne. James treats a dog who is late going into labour and whose owner is convinced she knows the right treatment. After a call, a local farmer invites James to stay for a bit o' bacon - which turns out to be almost pure fat; James finds a way to make it edible. James and Helen are on their honeymoon and start the tuberculin testing. They're staying at a local inn but are constantly interrupted by the landlady. Back at the practice, Siegfried is particularly harried and Tristan announces that he must return to Edinburgh to take his final exams. He nonetheless decides to help Tristan prepare. James is concerned with the generosity of Siegfried's wedding gift. James meets Angus Grier, a nearby vet, and his student Clinton. Grier invites James along on a call and provides him with a peculiar change of clothes. Siegfried suggests that they hire a student while Tristan is away. Tristan gets a visit from an old school friend, St. John, a bon vivant whom Siegfried took a dislike to long ago. Tristan can't bring himself to tell Siegfried he is staying at Skeldale House and as a result, he must also keep it secret from Mrs. Alton. Mrs. Donovan is again dispensing veterinary advice to all who will listen. Tristan is smitten - yet again - with a lovely client, Rosemary Brocklehurst, who has a sick tortoise. Siegfried has to deal with Walt Barnett, a nasty and demanding client who seems to go out of his way to be unpleasant. When Barnett needs a horse gelded, Siegfried has the perfect plan to get the better of him. James and Helen visit Jack Gilling's farm where Helen spent a great deal of time as a young girl. She is saddened by the decline in the use of farm horses but is pleased to see Badger, now the only remaining horse on the farmer. When Badger falls ill, Mr. Gilling has a difficult decision to make. Old Mrs. Clarke refuses to have anything to with her young neighbour, Franco Pedretti, because he is Italian and her son was killed in Italy in WW II. Siegfried tries to bring the two together and it turns out the two have a lot in common. James works with Bert Longshaw who is having major problems with some imported cows. Finally, Tricki Woo requires surgery, but Mrs. Pumphrey opts for a non-invasive, medical treatment, with particularly interesting side effects! With his new responsibilities, Tristan tries to convince skeptical farmers of the benefits of artificial insemination. Getting nowhere with Deirdre, Tristan accepts Calum's suggestion that she be invited for dinner where Calum will prepare a special dish for them. Unfortunately for Tristan, Deirdre and Calum seem to have a lot in common. James blames himself when a cow he was treating dies and he's now concerned that legal action might be taken against him. He also has to treat Humphrey Cobbs' pregnant dog. There's nothing wrong with the dog except when its owner who, when in his cups, phones James in a panic imagining the worse. Siegfried takes Calum to task over a resident owl he brought home to Skeldale House. Siegfried and Calum visit Mrs. Bond to treat one of her menagerie of cats. To his shock and dismay, Siegfried thinks he sees Boris, one of her more vicious tomcats that he was sure he had put down the year before. Turns out it's 'son of Boris' and Calum is subsequently called to treat him. Siegfried angrily criticizes Calum for having wildlife in the surgery, but then regrets his action when Calum receives the job offer of a lifetime: vet in a wild game reserve in Nova Scotia. James helps Mrs. Hazlitt determine if her pet has been properly trained as a sheepdog. For Calum and Deirdre the big day finally arrives and they are married. Of course, the men are a bit hung over from Calum's stag party the night before. It's February 1952 and Calum and Deirdre have a terrible row. She would like to talk more, hopefully about setting a date for their wedding, while Calum hasn't a clue why she is acting the way she is. Siegfried decides to try and play matchmaker and get the two of them back together again. Meanwhile, James meets Mr. Potts, a one-time client who is now elderly and retired and takes to visiting him and wife in their home from time to time to relieve some of their loneliness. Everyone is saddened by the sudden death of King George VI. Siegfried decides to take on a new student for a bit of practical experience. Calum is none too pleased but the student is a close friend's only child and he won't hear any complaints. Calum is also in a bad mood when Deirdre has to leave earlier than planned but regrets her departure less when the student, Emma Styles, arrives. She accompanies him on his rounds and he is quite taken with her but he questions whether it's practical for a woman to be involved in heavy animal work. Jack Sanders dog doesn't seem to be recovering from a fairly minor cut. Having just returned from a two week holiday in Scotland, James has trouble re-adjusting to work. On his first day back, he does his rounds in shorts, much to the amusement of local farmers. Siegfried heads off on his own holiday and that means a lot of extra work for both Calum and James. Deirdre come to spend a week to help them out and the practice receives an unexpected visit from a nearby vet. James and Helen attend the local horses races where James places a bet on a horse called The Jackpot. Tristan and James treat Mr. Pickersgill, a good farmer with a tendency toward malapropisms. Tristan has an injury while there, but finds an immediate remedy. Siegfried is called out to the Sidlows, who are a bit difficult. Tristan gives James advice on his honeymoon plans and suggests a Mediterranean cruise. James couldn't possibly afford it and Tristan suggests he try his hand betting at the track. Siegfried is invited to the Broughton races and he knows the racing circuit is looking for a new vet. Once there however he meets an old friend, Stewie Brannon, a fellow vet whom he's not seen for many years. Siegfried faces a dilemma when the Agriculture Ministry requires the practice to undertake tuberculin testing the same week of James and Helen's honeymoon. James proposes a solution. Siegfried's wedding gift surprises James. Siegfried and Tristan go out of their way to make themselves unavailable so Mr. Blenkinsopp recruits James to play for the local cricket team, with amusing results. James treats the Dimmocks' new puppy with all 8 (or so) children in attendance. James decides that the pup needs Granville Bennett's special touch but is concerned that he will only get into trouble so he asks Siegfried to come along. Granville convinces both of them to stop in at his branch surgery, which turns out to be his local. Once again, James has a few too many. Siegfried calls on the Blackwoods to treat a sick dog, but soon realizes that another member of the household is in need of care and arranges for the local doctor to pay a visit. Siegfried also has to deal with the very odd Mr. Hopps who seeks his advice on the care of his dog. Hopps never produces the dog however and Siegfried becomes aware that he is taking advantage of the situation at the Blackwood farm. James has trouble communicating with the farmhands at Lord Hulton's estate - until they decide he can do no wrong when picking winners for the football pools! James has to deal with Vernon Harker, a lazy farmer who neglects his stock and simply doesn't follow the vet's advice. Siegfried receives a surprise visitor in the surgery: Lady Hulton and her cat Bess, who has an eye infection. She usually visits Granville Bennett, but he is away on holidays and is surprised at Siegfried's interest in small animals. Siegfried in turn decides the time has come to focus more on small animal care. James calls on Sister Rose, who cares for stray dogs, and treats a lame pup. Siegfried deals with two brothers who are constantly bickering. He also treats Mr. Bootland's sick horse and receives an interesting offer. Lionel Brough decides to buy a pig farm, but runs into problems when his stock fall ill with what James suspects is swine fever. When Tristan finds himself the butt of a farmer's practical joke, he decides to return the favor. Tristan begins to see the writing on the wall when he learns Deirdre left her dogs in Calum's care. When Mrs. Dryden tells James that she is selling her house, he sets his sights on buying it at auction but the big question is whether he can afford it. Calum however surprises them all. Life is a bit more hectic than usual at Skeldale House with Siegfried away at a conference, Helen still confined to her bed and Tristan undertaking a round of farewell parties before heading off to Ireland. James' friend Andrew Bruce visits for a week and accompanies him on his rounds. James treats a horse with a mysterious ailment, Calum takes delight in gently tormenting a straight-arrow farmer and everyone grows tired of Tristan's limited culinary skills (which seem limited to bangers and mash - fried sausages and mashed potatoes). James panics when he realizes he didn't get Helen an anniversary present. Tristan returns to Darrowby after a lengthy absence and James decides to welcome him back in grand style - by playing a practical joke. He has Helen complete a romantic welcome back card and sign it Susie Parker. The last time Tristan saw Susie he was so drunk he couldn't remember if he had proposed to her. With both James and Sigfried now living away, Tristan will be the only occupant of Skeldale House and Sigfried's arranged for a new housekeeper, the widowed Mrs. Alton. Tristan is none too pleased that Sigfried has done this without consulting him but changes his mind when he meets Sylvia Alton. It's not all that simple however. James continues to have his usual encounters with Mr. Biggins. He also has to deal with a family who are indifferent to their seriously ill dog. Fortunately, their neighbors have an interest in the animal's well-being. Siegfried treats an over-active horse owned by the rather eccentric Darnley sisters, one of whom is convinced that Siegfried's powers over horses borders on witchcraft. James has several encounters with Mr Ripley who inconveniences the vets by keeping his gate padlocked. Mr. Ramsey leaves his Great Dane in the care of the vets. Still short-handed with Tristan away in Ireland, Siegfried proudly announces that he has arranged for a vet, Willy Bannister, to assist them for a fortnight. To Calum's dismay, Willie is teetotaller who is fond of opera, but he brightens somewhat when Willy claims to be a good cook. James has to deal with the Wains, a brother-sister team of farmers who have somewhat different approach to life and work. Helen is away caring for a sick aunt. Siegfried is on the warpath because of the number of unpaid farmers' bills. He is particularly annoyed with Dennis Pratt who has not settled his account for some time. James and Tristan have to treat a rather large and very difficult stallion. James meets Granville Bennett, a vet who specializes in small animal care, when Mrs. Barker's dog requires surgery. While the dog is recovering from the anesthetic, Granville suggests that he and James have a drink (or two or three, as it turns out) and then over to his house for a bite to eat (and a drink or two or three). By the time his visit is over, James is very much the worse for wear. James rescues a kitten by the side of the road. Calum nurses a young fox back to health but releasing it back to the wild proves to be more challenging than expected. Deirdre unexpectedly shows up in Darrowby on business, but is with someone called Anthony. Siegfried purchases a television in time to see the inaugural TV broadcast in the Dales; he even helps out one of the locals who won a television in a raffle. James and Helen treat an elderly gentleman's cat and only later realize that the owner is also in great need of care. Tristan receives a visit from Alice McTavish, a friend from Edinburgh. He's quite taken with her and she with him, but things don't quite work out in the end. She accompanies him on a call to treat a choking nanny goat - who has eaten something quite unusual! James overcomes his fears and takes the leap into public speaking - at the Darrowby Youth Club. On the big day, he's running late as usual with an over-abundance of calls and when he finally arrives, the audience proves to be quite formidable. James and Helen make an offer on a house but it's now up to the bank to provide them with a mortgage. Will their less-than-friendly banker oblige? Siegfried starts to lose confidence in their pharmaceutical supplier, Mr. Barge, thinking that he only has remedies from the dark ages. James disagrees and puts Mr. Barge to the test. Calum treats a flock of sheep with an everyday remedy. James and Helen are worried about David Braithwaite, a local sheep farmer who is quite depressed since the death of his wife the year before. He loses all interest in farming and decides to sell his farm. The local confectioner, Mr. Hatfield, has a sick cat and while James does his best to treat the cat, Mrs. Pumphrey and Mrs. Tibbett take an interest in Mr. Hatfield's well-being. Mrs. Pumphrey hears that James has a serious cough and advises him that Tricki Woo is most concerned. Siegfried takes Tristan to task for not mending a hole in the fence. Tristan announces that he now refuses to subject himself to Siegfried's tyranny but he is given 24 hours to mend the fence or face the consequences. Tristan tries to recruit James in his battle with Siegfried, but James will have nothing to do with it. Siegfried comes up with the perfect response. James operates on a sick calf but those assisting him are worse off than the calf. As a result, James comes down with a bad case of the flu. James is also concerned at having to give bad news to Andrew Vine about his dog, given his recent experience with Paul Cotterell.

"All-Star Blitz" was the last in a long-line of multi-celebrity games associated with game show producer Merrill Heatter, all which had in some way to do with his by far most successful effort, "The Hollywood Squares." In "All-Star Blitz" (incidentally hosted by "The Hollywood Squares" host Peter Marshall) two contestants, including a returning champion, competed with the help of four celebrities. Behind the celebrities' podiums was a wall of six electronic screens, which contained the words to a familiar phrase. The basic rules were similar to "The Hollywood Squares" (e.g., choose a celebrity, agree or disagree), but with the following changes: 1. When the contestant chose a celebrity, he/she also picked a star in in his/her column to light (i.e., "so-and-so at the bottom"); 2. The celebrity is asked a multiple-choice answer, and generally did not bluff; and 3. If the contestant was correct, he/she continued control of the board, but if not, control passed to the opponent. Whenever four stars around a screen were lit, that screen exposes part of the phrase. At any time, the contestant in control of the board may guess the phrase, always at the risk of losing control if incorrect. The first contestant to solve two puzzles won a prize package worth approximately $4,000 and advanced to the Blitz Bonanza Board. In The Blitz Bonanza, the object was for the contestant to solve one more word puzzle; by spinning a wheel, the contestant could highlight and reveal portions of the puzzle. Up to four spins were allowed, though spins could prove to be unhelpful if they designated an already-highlighted screen. If fewer than four screens were lit, the contestant could either solve the puzzle or trade the prize package already won in the front game (all previous winnings were considered safe) for one more spin. Following the fifth spin, the contestant has 10 seconds to review the puzzle; at the same time, the celebrities write down their guesses as to the correct phrase. At any time during the Blitz Bonanza, a correct guess was worth $10,000 (plus an additional $5,000 for each day not won, up to a maximum $25,000); an incorrect guess at any time stopped the Blitz Bonanza, though he/she could collect $250 per celebrity who guessed the puzzle correctly. Contestants competed until defeated or winning five games, at which point they also won a new car. All Summer Long follows 6 college age men and women who are selected to be "The Underclassmen" through a rigorous application process designed to test their spiritual, emotional, and comedic mettle. After a two-week boot camp during which they develop together as missionaries and performers, "The Underclassmen" embark on the ultimate road trip, spending each week at a different camp, performing, counseling, and serving. The world was exactly like ours EXCEPT that women were the dominate gender. Women were the captains of industry and men were household workers, secretaries and waiters trying to attract attention with their sexuality. To add some additional twists to that twist there were characters into dominance/submission, a woman who had been a man (played by Linda Gray) and, of course, women CEOs having affairs with their secretaries. A combination sketch comedy/musical performance show in the tradition of "Saturday Night Live," this program starred a teenage cast and was targeted at younger viewers.

A unique comedy that unfortunately only lasted for five broadcasts. Comedian and host George de Witt, along with a different guest comedian each week, would perform a series of comic sketches together. Making this show stand out from the rest was that all the performances were in a form of mime: the characters still spoke to one another, but the props and settings were entirely imaginary. A day in the life of Mob Underboss Frank Padalino. Not your typical mobster, Frank is a charmer who likes to laugh. The pilot concerns an old friend who has been sentenced to death by the mob. Archie Bunker, was a working-class family man who held bigoted, conservative views of the world. His viewpoints clash with nearly everyone he comes into contact with especially his liberal son-in-law Mike Stivic (or, as Archie delights in calling him, "Meathead"). Mike and Gloria have been going to a class that teaches them how to fight constructively, and their new-found knowledge opens their eyes as to what a doormat Edith is to Archie. They convince her that she has to stand up to Archie and bring their arguments to an equal balance. Edith is reluctant at first but when Archie comes home, everyone is shocked by how stubborn Edith can be when she puts her foot down. She and Archie get into a serious argument, the lynch-pin of which is the upcoming visit by her cousin whom Archie can't stand. Archie says no, but Edith sticks to her guns and refuses to back down. She ends up sleeping on the couch as a result and a confused and shell-shocked Archie tries to make amends. When the subject of Edith's cousin comes up again Archie begins the argument over again and still Edith won't back down. The day has come that Mike and Gloria are moving into their new home and Archie is practically pushing them out the door. Archie is being so obnoxious that Mike finally reaches a boiling point until he declares his independence and calls Archie a fathead. He and Gloria spend the night in their new home without electricity, plumbing or heat. Archie is overjoyed that the meathead is suffering but Edith's motherly instinct force her to intercede, she walks out and intends to suffer right along with the kids. Archie is all to happy to take care of himself but while making a mess in the kitchen, he runs across Gloria's bowl from when she was a baby and it melts his heart. He goes next door with a half-hearted apology and tells Mike and Gloria that they can stay at his house until the heat gets turned on. Edith's cousin Amelia and her husband Russell comes to visit despite the fact that Archie can't stand either one. Amelia won't shut up about how wonderful Russell is, and Russell won't shut up about how much money he makes. Archie tries to excuse himself from their love-fest by going down to Kelcy's only to find that Russell wants to go with him. Separately, both Edith and Archie find out how much trouble Russell and Amelia's marriage is in. Amelia tells Edith that she is ready to divorce Russell because the fire has gone out of their sex life. Meanwhile Russell tells Archie about his appetite for young girls. Returning home, Russell and Amelia say their goodbyes leaving Archie and Edith with a new appreciation of their relationship. Gloria is sick with the flu, and soon Archie may be too. When Edith makes a stew with mushrooms, it isn't until Archie has some that Mike intervenes and tells him about a recall of Poconos Mushrooms that have been reported to have boccelism. The family panics and takes Archie to the doctor where he has to wait in the waiting room and then endures a painful shot. When he gets home, he gets the idea for a lawsuit only to have Edith break the news that he didn't eat Poconos but a brand with a similar label. Archie doesn't have boccelism, but does acquire Gloria's flu. It is Archie's 50th birthday and everyone is getting ready for his party, except the guest of honor who claims to be only 49. During the party he gets depressed and makes his way to Kelcy's Bar until everyone is ready to admit his real age. While there, Mr. Quigley comes to comfort him, reminding him of how many good years he has left. Archie is convinced to go home, but Quigley reveals that he has actually brought the party to Kelcy's. Archie befriends an elderly Jewish watchmaker named Bernie Bernstein who has come up with an invention that the thinks could make the both of them millionaires, a remote control for the doorbell. All he needs from Archie is $1000 to get started, which Archie just happens to have. Edith objects, and the more Archie tries to shut her up, the louder her objections become, especially when the remote either doesn't work or rings every doorbell in the neighborhood. Eventually it comes to light that Mr. Bernstein is a very sick man, and eventually dies right there on their couch. Archie wakes up one Sunday morning to find a swastika has been painted on his front door. At first he thinks it might have been a bunch of juvenile delinquents who might have done it. However, it is soon learned that it was meant for a Jewish activist who lives the next block over. Things become even more heated when a member of a radical Jewish vigilante organization offers to protect the Bunkers even though it might mean busting a few heads. However, at the end of their meeting with the man, the Bunkers receive a dose of sobering reality when it comes to racial violence. Irene comes over to invite Edith to the museum. While Edith is getting ready, Irene gets into a discussion with Archie about the inferiority of female athletes versus male athletes. Irene calls off the trip to the museum when her conversation with Archie ends with a bet that she can best him in a game of pool down at Kelcy's Bar. Archie comes to understand what a good player she might be, but also fears that he might lose because Frank puts and old Italian curse on him called a malocchio - or "evil eye". Archie claims to throw out his back moments before leaving for Kelcy's bar and the game is postponed. At the game, Frank tricks him by throwing money on the floor, proving that there is nothing wrong with his back, forcing him to have to play the game anyway. Irene beats the pants off of him. Archie is outraged when he finds a spicy letter that Mike wrote Gloria before they were married. In trying to defend them, Edith reveals that she once spent a weekend in the country with Freddy Whithouse while Archie was overseas during the war. He is so hurt that she kept it a secret that he leaves. Mike goes down to the bar to talk Archie into coming back. When he comes home, he manages to get Edith to apologize even though there was nothing to apologize for. Archie endures one sleepless, crazy night as he paces the floor worrying about some upcoming layoffs at the plant. First the family tries and fails to comfort him. Then a pesky drunk keeps calling the house. Then a neighborhood cop drops by and offers a trap for the caller. Then the neighbor drops in. Then a pizza man shows up. Finally, the security guard from Archie's plant drops by to deliver the good news that despite the firings, Archie isn't among them. While out on an errand with Mike, Archie witnesses a mugging. Despite objections from the family, he refuses to tell the police what he saw mostly because the victim was Italian and he believes that the Mafia was involved. When he is forced to turn in a report, he gives false information claiming that the muggers were two Mafia hit-men in suits in a fancy car. Later, Mr. Vicino, the victim, comes by the house and lays out the whole story, that Archie saw the mugger and he didn't. But their stories don't match and Vicino accuses Archie of backing out on testifying because he is prejudice against Catholics. Gloria notices that Archie testimony has made the papers, that the mob has been accused of the crime. Edith gets a phone call saying that a man named Silvestri from an Italian defamation agency is coming over to talk to Archie, who is convinced that he is a hit-man who is coming to whack him. When he arrives, the man asks Archie for the details and he is so frightened that he tells the truth. When another man comes to the door claiming to be Silvestri, the first man reveals that he is police detective. The detectives leaves him alone with Mr. Silvestri who informs Archie that it may be wise to tell the truth and leave a certain organization beginning with the letter 'M' out of his statement. The kids go away on vacation leaving Archie and Edith alone for the first time in years. Edith tries to get an uninterested Archie to do something fun but fails at every turn until she suggests a game of cards. The game turns into an argument, Archie hurts her feelings and storms out of the house. Later, he comes back in a better mood and the two have a deep conversation about what they wanted to do with their lives before they got married. Archie wanted to be a ball player and Edith wanted to be a famous ballroom dancer. Finally, he apologizes - sort of - for the things he said earlier. They share a passionate kiss just as Mike and Gloria return home. Mike brings home a game called Group Therapy which asks players to open up about certain private feelings. He invites Lionel and the Lorenzos over the play, but the game turns out to be less fun then he had planned when he begins acting childish about everyone's reaction to him. He accuses everyone of criticizing him just as harshly as Archie. Edith straightens him out by explaining that Archie doesn't hate him but criticizes him because he sees in Mike all the things that he can never be. Archie comes home completely oblivious to what is going on. Mike says he understands and hugs him. Archie is inflamed by an anti-gun editorial on the news and gets into a massive argument with Mike and Gloria about gun control that ends with him calling the station and scheduling a televised rebuttal. When he gets on television, he makes a fool out of himself by suggesting, among other things, that the best way to deal with hijacked airlines is to arm the passengers before their get on board and take the guns away with they depart. At Kelsey's bar after the editorial airs, the family shares a drink when a man comes in who saw the broadcast. He seems nice until he robs them at gunpoint. Archie flies into full-bird panic when a man comes by asking questions about his neighbor Larry Grundy, who has been his friend for 15 years. He suspects that the man may be from the F.B.I. investigating Larry to find out if he is really a subversive. Archie becomes suspicious and suspects that his house is being bugged as part of a sting operation. He and Larry get into a screaming match in the living room over who may or may not secretly be pink. Larry calls off their friendship and is about to leave when Archie gets a call from work telling him that the investigation is not being conducted by the F.B.I., but by The Air Force due to a defense contract that ended six months earlier. Edith suggests that Archie and Larry patch things up, but Larry refuses and quietly walks out the door. A power outage and reports of looting in the city prompt Mike to write a letter to the editor about how greedy governments do the same in the name of free enterprise. At the bar, Archie vents his frustrations about how Mike always argues his point and doesn't see things his way. Two men - who have been listening in - approach Archie and suggest that he come to a meeting of the Kweens Kouncil of Krusaders (a chapter of the Klu Klux Klan), where they will come up with a more severe way of "teaching" Mike a lesson. Archie learns that Gordie and Mitch - the two men he met earlier at his bar - plan to burn a cross on the Stivic's lawn and must come up with a way to stop them. When Archie tries to persuade Mike to write a new letter to the editor (recanting his previous stance on free enterprise), he lets slip that he had spoken with known Klu Klux Klan members. Mike is outraged and tells Archie to go away, but Archie is still determined to stop the cross burning - even if it means he will be the KKK's next target. Irene gives Gloria a replica of Rodin's statue "The Kiss" which she immediately falls in love with. Archie is offended by the nudity, sparking a debate with Mike and Gloria over what is art and what is filth. In their absence, Archie gives the statue to Frank who is stunned that Irene gave it to Gloria in the first place. Gloria is outraged and refuses to speak to her father. As an apology, Archie buys her a peace offering, a horrendous statue of a woman with a fish on her head. Gloria hates the statue but loves her father for the gesture. Archie narrowly escapes a potentially deadly accident at the dock, prompting him to see the light. But can he deal with the demands of Christianity, especially after he is asked to drive a church bus on the same day he was looking forward to going to a New York Jets game? The family goes away for the weekend leaving Archie alone in the house by himself. He waves off Irene's instructions about the broken lock on the cellar door and ends up getting himself stuck down there. Alone with only a tape recorder and a bottle of Vodka to keep him company, he records his last will and testament as the ghosts of his loved ones appear and give their opinions of him. A man to the cellar comes to help him. Archie, who is drunk, thinks it is the voice of God who has come to take him home. When the man gets the door open, Archie is shocked when he sees a black man. Archie has been home from work with back problems, compounded by worries that the man who is filling in for him is younger and faster. He ends up in the hospital for surgery and, while there, strikes up a friendship with the man in the next bed. Archie likes the man and even invites him over for dinner. This is mostly because a faulty partition blocks his view of the man who is not only French but is also black. Mike and Lionel decide to become part of an anti-war protest, but it isn't until they leave that Gloria gets the news that the situation is turning violent. She and Edith urge Archie to go down to the protest and bring him home. Mike comes home frazzled but unharmed, but Archie ends up in the slammer surrounded by commies, hippies and drop-outs. Mike secures his release because the police captain is Polish, but Archie doesn't know that and offends the captain, leaving him to stay in jail a little longer. It is finally time for Mike and Gloria to have a break from little Joey for the evening and they hire a babysitter named Sharyl to watch him. Archie checks in but is none too thrilled by her choice of studies - Aboriginal sexuality - nor her hippie boyfriend whom she takes to smooching with on the couch. Archie throws them both out and takes little Joey over to his house just as the guys are converging for their poker night. He becomes irritated by the chatter and the noise from his buddies until they come together to try and help little Joey get to sleep. Archie is up for a promotion to the dispatcher at the loading dock against Black Elmo, and decides to darken his hair to look different. He'll do anything to get the position and in doing so he signs an organ donor card without even reading it. Fearful that he won't get into Heaven if he donates his organs (because he fears that the recipients will use them for sinful purposes) he goes back to the office and asks the boss to tear up the donor card, claiming that he isn't a well man. His boss, Mr. Sanders, agrees and decides that the dispatcher job needs a healthy man who is going to be around for a long time, so he gives the job to Black Elmo instead. Archie comes home with gifts for Edith and Gloria, making Mike wonder where he got the extra money. Edith becomes furious when she pieces together that Archie has started gambling on horses again even though he promised 20 years ago that he would never gamble again. During a particularly angry argument, Edith slaps Archie causing him to leave. Down at Kelsey's bar, Barney Hefner convinces Archie that the only way to deal with her is either through the silent treatment or by getting tough. He takes up the latter and storms home only to find that it doesn't work. Edith reads and apology letter that Archie thinks is an apology to him, but actually it is a letter that he wrote to her 20 years ago promising never to gamble again. Reluctantly, he updates the letter by resigning it. Archie comes home all excited because he has been deemed a hero. It seems that while driving Munson's cab the woman in the backseat passed out, and he administered mouth-to-mouth and brought her around again. Later, the woman, named Beverly, comes by the house to thank him. While talking to Edith, Beverly reveals something startling - she is really a man, a female impersonator. When Archie comes back and attempts conversation, Beverly takes the wig off and reveals the truth. Archie is humiliated and doesn't want any press, despite the fact that a reporter is looking for him. The reporter catches up with him at Kelcy's and starts asking questions but Archie wants to forget the whole thing. The reporter goes into the men's room where he catches Beverly and returns demanding the truth from Archie. Beverly saves him by telling the reporter that it was a truck driver who administered CPR. Archie is grateful and tells her that for a dame, she's one hell of a guy. When Archie's lodge, The Kings of Queens, is accused in the press of excluding minorities, he and the brothers have to come up with a plan to change the public perception. Archie hits on the idea of allowing a token black and a token Jew into the lodge to take the heat off. Fortunately, a guy from work, Solomon Jackson is both. He invites Jackson to his house to talk it over with him and lets him know that he wants him in the club, but that he doesn't actually have to show up. Solomon is on to him, and he sarcastically lets him know that he is proud to be part of the club and that he will be proud to invite more black members and more Jewish members to join. Archie is in a grouchy mood because all of his business has moved down the street to McPheeney's place. One of his friends drops by and introduces him to a solution for his funk - in the form of a pill. Archie takes the pill and suddenly has a burst of energy that makes him ready to paint the front porch at 3 in the morning. Mike is the first to catch on that Archie is hooked on something so the family goes to visit him at the bar and he begins acting erratically and talking nonsense. Suddenly he begins to come down from the high and slips into a serious depression, realizing how far he has fallen and breaks down in tears. Episode #136 - Archie finds himself in a compromising situation with an attractive waitress after Edith ignores his amorous advances and dashes off to the Sunshine Home. Janis Paige guest stars as Denise, the attractive waitress whose flirtations with Archie lead him to trouble on the home front. Archie finds himself in a compromising situation with an attractive waitress after Edith ignores his amorous advances and dashes off to the Sunshine Home. Janis Paige guest stars as Denise, the attractive waitress whose flirtations with Archie lead him to trouble on the home front. Episode #137 - And estranged Archie and Edith are determined to prove to each other that they are perfectly content going their separate ways, in the conclusion of a three-part presentation. The going gets tough for a while when the Bunkers continue to resist Mike and Gloria's efforts to reconcile them. Archie comes home with a wounded wrist and the news that he was mugged. He tells Edith and Gloria that, while driving his cab, a young man pulled a switch blade on him and demanded money. Archie fought him off with a small teargas sprayer that he got from a magazine. A police officer comes around and begins asking questions, and shocks Archie when he informs him that it is illegal for him to possess a teargas sprayer and gives him a summons to appear in court. Later, in court Archie tries to explain his case to the judge (who is black) and is informed that using the sprayer could cost him up to seven years in prison. He is also surprised to learn that the mugger was caught but set free because the cop didn't read him his rights in English. Also, cop is at fault because he searched the Bunker house for the sprayer without a warrant. The case is dismissed. A man comes by the house claiming that The Bunker's have a problem with heat loss in their home. He bars up the basement, and has Archie sign a contract for aluminum siding that he says he will get for free despite the fact that their house is brick. Edith reads the fine print and finds out that it will cost them $2000 no matter what happens. Archie is too stubborn to listen to Edith's good advice and signs the contract anyway. After the man leaves, Irene comes by to tell them that the man is scam artist who inspected their house with a light meter and a lot of phony advice. Archie is stuck with the contract and when the man shows us to start putting up the siding, it takes Mike, Gloria, George, Louise and Irene to get him out of the contract. Archie goes to war with Barney Hefner over the issue of his misbehaving dog. What sparks the squabble is that when the dog defecates on his lawn, he is proud to take it and dump it on Hefner's porch. Leaving for work, however, Archie backs up the cab and accidentally runs over the dog, not killing it but injuring it. Archie discovers that he has a small tax problem. Seems he didn't think it was important to claim the money that he made on his part-time cab driving job. He goes down to the Internal Revenue Service to talk to them but he offends the man, who is black. In response, the agent tells him that he is going to audit his returns for the last three years. Archie lends a hand to Irene by getting her a job down at the loading dock. The guys don't like it and start a petition to get her fired - putting Archie in charge of delivering it to personnel. The boss tells him to find the guy who is passing around the petition so he can fire him and also instructs him to tell the boys to leave Irene alone. Archie pockets the petition and returns to the loading dock where he tells the guys to get off her back. Returning home, Irene comes over and thanks him for standing up for her. He then receives a shock when he finds out that she is making the same amount of money that he is. Still unemployed, Archie checks into the hospital for gall bladder surgery, a situation that proves to be anything but routine. Not only does he find Edith reading a Playgirl in the waiting room, he has to deal with a smart aleck Puerto Rican nurse and then a burly West Indian surgical assistant who preps him for surgery by giving him a shave . . . but not on his chin. While still in the hospital, Archie drives the hospital staff crazy with this constant complaining, and then is told the distressing news that he has a very rare blood type and that the only donor is the black West Indian nurse whose been looking in on him. Archie fears that having blood from a black woman will not only cause him to grow breasts but will make him more of a tiger in the bedroom. After the surgery, he gets to go home where Edith makes several unsuccessful attempts to get him to take his medicine. A former co-worker comes by to tell him the good news that not only did he get his job back but that he has been promoted. While in the hospital recovering for his addition to pills, Archie's bar is left in the hands of his young assistant. When he gets home and starts to get back on his feet, he learns that the only action in the bar has been the repo men who have come by to clean the place out. Archie becomes a recluse, locking himself in his bedroom and proclaiming that he won't come out until 1997. Edith talks a very reluctant Harry (Archie's former bar tender) to come to the house and talk to him. Archie wants nothing to do with Harry and still maintains that he still intends to stay in bed. That is, until the rest of the family joins him. Angry, he finally gets up and has words with Harry, reluctantly agreeing to be partners 60/40. Archie is happy with the news that an old high school buddy Bummy is coming by for dinner but is less thrilled that he is bringing his wife Dolores, whom Archie had a brief encounter with while he and Edith were dating. Fearful that Edith will find out, he is a nervous wreck all through dinner. Alone in the kitchen, Edith reveals that she knows about the whole thing but Dolores had forgotten all about it. Before they leave, Dolores and Archie have a moment and she pretends that she remembers everything. Edith tells Archie that she knew about the whole thing and that there are no hard feelings. Yet, she leaves a minor suspicion in his mind that Edith wasn't as innocent as he might have thought. Archie begins behaving like an angry child when Edith puts him on the diet at the orders of his doctors to lose 25 pounds. Fed up with Edith's attempts to lower sodium and cholesterol, he storms out of the house and begins taking his meals at Kelcy's. But even Kelcy gets irritated with his constant temper tantrums. Finally, he gets some useful advice from Justin Quigley while the old man is out jogging. He shows Archie pictures of his family, all of whom died young because they didn't take care of themselves and warns Archie that he'd better do the same if he wants to dance at Joey's wedding someday. Archie falls, yet again, for one of Pinky Peterson's practical jokes. Meanwhile, at home, Edith is greeted by Beverly LaSalle, the transvestite that Archie saved a year earlier in his cab. Archie comes home and Beverly invites he and Edith out to dinner, but Archie refuses until he sees a perfect plan to get back at Pinky for all the years that he put one over on him. He decides to invite Pinky but not tell him that Beverly is a man. Edith and Beverly want no part of this but Archie insists. When Pinky comes over and Archie and Edith are upstairs changing, Pinky lets Beverly know that he knows that he is a man. At the restaurant, the plot is unfurled almost immediately and it looks like Archie has egg on his face until Pinky's fiancï¿½ shows up and becomes infuriated. She breaks off the wedding when she finds out that Beverly is a man. Archie is a nervous wreck because he wants to back out of the annual minstrel show at the lodge, which he has successfully avoided for several years. Lodge brothers Barney Hefner and Ed Bradley blackmail him by asserting that if Archie doesn't go on with the show, he will be kicked out of the lodge and lose all the benefits therein. Meanwhile, Mike and Gloria try to have a nice dinner at an Italian restaurant to take their minds off the fact that she is a week overdue. When Gloria admits that she is having contractions, which she didn't want to admit because she didn't want to spoil the evening, Mike panics and tries to get her to the hospital. Trying to call the lodge to tell her mother and father that she is in labor, she becomes stuck in the phone booth. Meanwhile, Archie and Edith get the message and have to leave the lodge to get to the hospital. Barney and Ed think that it is just one more excuse to get out of going onstage, and they take the cold cream, forcing Archie to have to show up at the hospital in black face. Archie is forced to show up at the hospital for the birth of his grandchild in black face, When his lodge brothers refused to give him their cold cream because he left, He and Edith are surprised to discover that Mike and Gloria haven't arrived - first they that Gloria was stuck in a phone booth at the restaurant and then they found themselves stuck in traffic. All is well, they get to the hospital, Gloria has the baby and Archie manages to borrow cold cream from a terrified elderly woman. The lodge brothers show up and tell him that they understand and that it would be heartless to throw him out of the lodge at the birth of his first grandchild, whom Mike and Gloria name Joseph Michael Stivic. While Archie is away at his reunion with his old Army buddies, Frank and Irene invite Edith, Gloria and Mike to a movie. Gloria comes home with a surprise for Mike, a short black bobbed wig, which turns Mike on so much that he decides that they need to stay home. Getting ready to make love, Mike is aghast that Gloria has taken it off and she accuses him of loving the wig more than he loves her. They stop speaking to each other until the next day when he explains that the wig would be nothing without her in it. Edith is busy mailing a series of chain letters thinking that good luck will befall her if she sends them and bad luck with pursue her if she doesn't. Archie thinks she crazy and then receives one himself, which he promptly throws in the wastebasket. Irene warns him about the dangers of throwing the letter away but Archie scoffs her suggestion. Almost immediately bad things begin to happen, the worst of which takes place at Kelcy's when Archie accidentally drinks beer from a glass that was previously used by Bert Munson - who has hepatitis. In a panic, Archie goes to the emergency room and not only runs afoul of a smart-Alec black doctor but a nurse without a sense of humor. It's Christmas Day and Archie refuses to be in a good mood, despite the family's attempts to cheer him up. All day he can't seem to get away from people who are either happy or want money. After much aggravation, plus a visit from Jeffersons, Archie finally admits that he didn't get his Christmas bonus because his team at work was fined because an order was suppose to be shipped to London, Ontario was instead shipped to London, England. Mike, Gloria and Archie are sick and Edith is running herself into a frazzle trying to keep up with their needs. She enlists the help of her cousin Maude Finley whom Archie can't stand because she is an outspoken bleeding heart liberal. Upon her arrival, the two get into a huge fight over Franklin Roosevelt, whom Archie hated and Maude adored. As the argument comes to a close, Edith reveals that she's sick and that Maude will stick around to take care of her. The next day, Archie is dismayed by the fact that Maude is staying because now she is sick too. Archie comes home to an empty house, no Edith, no dinner and no beer in the fridge. Edith comes home and starts preparing dinner, telling Archie that she has been volunteering at a nursing home. She feels a sense of pride that she is doing something fulfilling but Archie is angry that it is taking her away from the home. She insists that the volunteer work is important but Archie determines to put her in her place. Edith won't be put in her place and an argument breaks out with Archie trying to control her and Edith standing her ground. He tries to leave but she leaves first. Later, when she comes back, Archie takes her out to dinner and surprises him by telling him that she isn't volunteering at the home anymore because they have offered to pay her for her services. Edith brings an old man by the house who wants to call his daughter to come pick him up. It seems that he has escaped from the old folks home because he was tired of the drab existence there. Archie is befuddled by the man and wants him to make his call and leave. The daughter won't talk to the old man so he makes arrangements with his girlfriend to come and pick him up. The presence of the man makes Archie begin to feel his age and fear that his declining years are right around the corner. The man leaves Archie with simple advice: Get old, but don't grow old. While out shopping, Edith gives a woman directions, but then realizes that she has given her the wrong information. She chases the woman into the street and is caught by security who nab her for supposedly stealing a wig. She is put on a blacklist and is made to understand that her credit will be no good at any store where she tries to shop. Edith begins to worry that she is becoming a kleptomaniac - or 'klepper' as she calls it - and is urged by Mike and Gloria to see a psychiatrist. Instead, she goes to see Father Majeski, the priest whose car she had once dented. He helps her work out the problem by getting her to talk about it. In the middle of their conversation, Edith come to the conclusion that she is not a 'klepper' but merely absent-minded. Edith's cousin Amelia sends her an old mink because she just purchased a new one. Edith is excited but Archie insists that she give it back. During dinner, an accident causes her to spill spaghetti sauce all over it. Archie sends it over to the Jeffersons who not only can't get the stain out, but destroy the mink the process. They offer The Bunkers an insurance check worth $300. Amelia and her husband Russ come to visit and he and Archie get into an argument when Russ begins comparing his home to theirs. When Louise drops off the check, Russ insists on taking it, but Archie makes it clear that he intends to keep it. That is, until he discovers that it is made out to Russ. Edith is sequestered while serving jury duty for a high-profile murder case. The other juror's believe the man to be guilty but Edith is the lone hold-out because she has a gut feeling that he is innocent. In her absence, Archie puts Mike and Gloria through misery because he wants Edith home she she can serve him. After two days, Edith's hunch turns out to be right and the man is found innocent, much to the chagrin of an unimpressed Archie. Edith writes a poem and gets a letter from a company that wants to turn it into a song for only $30. Archie buys a "dog alarm" and a gun to protect the house all for only $60. The family gets into an argument over which is more important and Archie agrees to give the gun back. That night two burglars, who have just robbed a jewelry store, break into the house and hold the Bunker's hostage until the heat is off. At one point, the thief threatens to take off with the $30 but Edith talks him out of it by offering to sing the song. After hearing her singing, they decide that the Bunkers are in such sad shape that it would be cruel to rob them. The next day Archie reads in the newspaper that the crooks were arrested, and Mike reveals that he fixed the Dog Alarm by replacing it with Edith's singing. Archie threatens to sue Joe Girgis, the laundromat owner, when his machine breaks down and destroys the laundry. Girgis, the man who owns the laundromat threatens to sue Archie on the claim the Archie overloaded the machine. Mike suggests that rather than settle it in court, they should find an honest person to settle the matter in private. Girgis suggests that Edith should be that person. In hearing the case, Edith decides to remove herself from the case because she knows who is guilty. She remembers setting the scale back five pounds because she knows that Archie gets mad when he gains weight, so Archie was unknowingly at fault. A badly shaken Edith tells Archie, Mike and Gloria about her encounter with the rapist and that she managed to fight him off. Two weeks after the attack, Edith is still shaken by what happened and refuses to come to the station to identify the suspect. Gloria finally manages to persuade her mother to snap out of her shaken self and help bring her attacker to justice. Edith has an accident in a parking lot involving a runaway shopping cart and leaves her name and phone number on the car. This angers Archie who thought she could have gotten away with it otherwise. When he finds out that the damages will be $197, he is dead-set on not paying it. The man - who turns out to be a priest - comes over to discuss matters and is suspicious that the priest may be on the up and up. Even when the man reveals his credentials, Archie refuses to pay for the damage. It turns out that the damage was only $14, but the priest is so offended by Archie that even when he offers to pay the $14, the priest tells him that he doesn't want his money. The priest leaves but comes back to tell him that he doesn't want money for the repairs but he will be happy to donate it to a Catholic charity. Archie is upset that Edith is spending so much time with Irene Lorenzo, going to her Catholic services and concerts. When Father Majesky drops off some pamphlets of information about Catholicism, Archie begins to suspect that Edith might be converting. He visits Majesky in his office to tell him not to try and convert her, but the good father talks him down. So does Edith, who tells him that she is only interested in learning about someone else's religion. Edith's Aunt Rose passes away, and as Edith prepares for the funeral, Archie steadfastly refuses to go. Seems that Edith and Aunt Rose were at odds over her decision to marry Archie, so they hardly spoke. When she gets to the funeral home for the visitation, she is stunned to discover that she is the only one who showed up to pay her last respects. There at the casket she makes one last attempt to make amends with her aunt despite the intrusion of the funeral director who keeps coming by to retrieve chairs for the funeral next door. Two people do eventually show up. One is a young man who has the wrong room, and the other is Archie who has changed his mind and wants to be by Edith's side in her time of need. Edith goes to Scranton to attend a family wedding and meets up with her aunts, who remind her of her cousin Roy, whom she knew as a child. Later, in a restaurant, Edith runs into cousin Roy and the two rekindle the old days. He makes it clear that they aren't really blood relatives and, without words, makes it understood that he is interested in her romantically. Edith becomes conflicted because she knows how charming Roy is, and even begins to share some of the same feelings. Just before the wedding, Roy comes by her hotel room and the two share a dance together, but before things get too far, Edith fakes a phone call to Archie back home. Roy, out of respect, quietly leaves. Back home, Edith is touched that Archie missed her and while hugging him looks at the corsage that Roy gave her and throws it away. Gloria buys Edith a suit, complete with pants, but Edith isn't sure about it because Archie is against women wearing pants. She encourages Edith to ask Archie to take her out somewhere. Archie comes home in a foul mood, unimpressed with the suit and demanding that Edith get dinner on the table. She insists that he take her somewhere but he refuses, so she puts on her coat and goes down to Kelcy's. The place is crowded and Edith makes a few new friends and starts playing the piano. Archie comes in, irritated at her new found popularity and demands that she come home. She goes, but first tells her new friends that she'll be back. Archie is excited about a trip that he is planning with Edith to go to Disney World, but something goes wrong when Edith begins to have mood swings and hot and cold flashes. One moment she is sweet and lovable, the next she is angry and defensive - even telling Archie to stifle. Gloria explains that she is just going through the early stages of menopause but Edith translates it as her first step toward the old folk's home. Archie, meanwhile, is forced to do things against his own nature when he has to nurture and be understanding toward Edith even though it is driving him insane. Archie slips into a bout of depression when he finds out from his insurance company's physical that a spot appeared on the X-Ray on his liver. Despite the fact that the doctor isn't sure what the spot is, Archie is convinced that the end is near. His first response is to be nice to Edith, and his second is to retire to his bedroom to wait out the inevitable. Joe Tucker, an old friend of Archie's comes calling whom he thinks has made himself into a huge success. It turns out that things are not so good for Joe. Not only is he out of work but he's been seeing a psychiatrist. He applied for a job at the docks and Archie thinks that he might be after his job. At work, the manager calls Archie in to ask questions about Joe's character, and Archie tells the boss about the psychiatrist. Not only does Joe get the job, despite this but he becomes Archie's new supervisor. Questions of honesty and morality come into the Bunker household when Archie, borrows some tools from work for a home project. As the family tries to guilt him, their crimes come to light. Gloria has been taking lipstick samples from the cosmetics counter where she works. Mike leaves coded messages in order to get around accepting a collect call. And all Edith can come up with is that she took a bite out of pretzel behind a vendor's back when she was eight. Archie tries to hide his crime from a co-worker that Edith has invited to dinner, but whom he has offended. In the end, Archie finds that karma has come down on him as the plywood that he bought for the project has been stolen off the back porch, and the window breaks when he slams the door. The family goes out to dinner and gets into an argument after the refrigerator goes out and they call two repairmen who are unable to fix it. They have an argument over how it really happened and we see their different perspectives. Archie remembers the he was pleasant and that the repairmen were crooks. Mike remembers that Archie was a bear and that the men were pleasant. Then Edith weighs in with what really happened and it turns out that Archie was the one who broke it. On Mike and Gloria's second anniversary, the family reminisces about the days leading up the wedding. Mike's Uncle Casimir came all the way from Chicago to discuss the wedding plans, but Mike was in a panic fearing that Archie would offend him with Polish jokes. Archie and Casimir nearly come to blows over disagreements over wedding plans, everything from the food to the music to the officiant. Things gets so heated that Mike calls off the wedding and walks out. During a flashback to Mike and Gloria's wedding, Mike stormed out the house over a fight between Archie and Uncle Casimer. He comes back out of shame and then the question arises of who will officiate the ceremony, a priest or a minister. Mike and Gloria want a civil ceremony and after much familial conflagration the officiate turns out to be a judge. It is Mike and Gloria's first anniversary and, over dinner, the family reminisces about the first time that Mike came over for dinner. At that first meeting, Mike and Archie immediately established their hatred for one another starting with an argument over Vietnam, leading Mike to storm out of the house vowing never to return. After a heated argument between Archie and Gloria, Mike returns and the two attempt to have a civil conversation about baseball that escalates into another shouting match that reveals that Mike and Gloria not only plan to get married but that they plan to spend four years living under Archie's roof. George tries to butter up the people in the neighborhood because he is running for city counsel under the guise that he wants to improve things in his community. In reality, he has plans to buy the florist shop next door to his dry cleaner and knock down the wall so he can expand his business. Unfortunately, he needs Archie's signature on the petition in order to get other people in the neighborhood to sign it. Lionel opens his big mouth about George's plan to Archie but then tells his father that the plan won't work because the floral shop is in a district that he would be working in. On a lazy Sunday morning Gloria gets fired up about women's liberation, in particular the way that she thinks that Archie treats Edith like his personal slave. She gets no help from the usually liberal Mike who believes that men and women are total equals but only when women are willing to admit their inferiority to men. A heated argument ensues that leaves Gloria storming out the front door. The next day she comes back to gather some of her things and he lets her know that without her there is no joy in his life. Another fight breaks out only this time it leads to make-up sex and all is bliss. Archie hits the roof when he learns Gloria is pregnant and unemployed college student Mike has no means to support his soon-to-be child. But just as he's changing his tune, Archie learns that Gloria became suddenly ill and suffered a miscarriage. Gloria is an emotional wreck due to the fact that she is nine days overdue. Mike tries unsuccessfully to make her feel better, but it all for nothing, she'd rather make war than love. She accuses him of being ignorant of her needs, especially when he decides to go to a basketball game rather than stay home for the baby shower. During the shower, Gloria makes it known that she currently has a distaste for Michael when suddenly he bursts through the door in a panic. While at the basketball game, he heard Gloria's doctor paged over the loudspeaker and assumed that she had gone into labor. Gloria realizes that he does care and they make up. He admits that he can never understand what she is going through, but out of sympathy he had six pickles with ice cream at the game. Mike and Gloria bring an eccentric artist friend, Szabo Daborba, who specializes in painting abstract female nudes over to the house . When Szabo suggests that Gloria pose for him, it sparks an angry debate between Archie and Mike over the morality of art and decency, but it also allows Archie to plant some doubt in Mike's mind over whether Szabo will take advantage of Gloria. As Archie and Mike are getting ready for a fishing trip, Gloria comes home feeling down. The family tries to get to the bottom of what's bothering her to no avail. Finally, when Archie and Mike leave for their trip, Edith has a talk with Gloria about a brief moment years ago when she wondered if she really loved Archie. Gloria realizes that this is her problem, that sometimes wonders if she loves Mike. Mike is so worried about her that she comes home before even reaching the lake. Unfortunately, he has Archie's fishing pole. Gloria, now in her seventh month, is feeling unattractive. Added to that is the fact that Mike is tutoring an attractive young woman in Economics and suspects that something else might be going on. That night, when Mike goes to tutor the woman, they both become mutually attracted to one another leading to a kiss. Meanwhile, Archie gets an idea to trap Mike in a confession. Knowing that he can't hold his wine, Archie decides to try and liquor him up as a truth drug. They both get drunk and right before Mike confesses, Archie passes out, missing the part where he confesses that he simply got up and left the woman's apartment. The furnace at the Bunker house goes kaput, so Archie and Edith are forced to spend a few days staying with Mike and Gloria to keep warm. Added to the fact that Mike and Archie don't get along is the still boiling issue of Archie having Joey baptized without her parent's consent. Archie makes a fool of himself with his annoying habits and nearly drives Mike right out of his own house. Things go from bad to worse until the power goes out and everyone sits in the dark by candlelight and all is calm again. Questions of sexual equality enter the Bunker household when Gloria's friend Tammy comes over and asks an age-old riddle about the identity of a surgeon who can't operate. Archie is stumped and so is Mike, so Archie takes the riddle down the Kelsey's bar and asks supposed riddle-master Barney Hefner. He can't figure it out either, so Archie goes back home where the riddle is finally solved by Edith. Gloria comes home shaken up and wearing clothes borrowed from a friend. She won't tell Mike what is wrong, but eventually she relents and tells her mother that she was walking by a construction site when a man pulled her behind a fence and tried to rape her. She passed out and he ran away. The question then becomes whether to report it or not. Edith convinces her by telling her how, when she was a teenager, a man tried to attack her in the same fashion. Gloria decides to tell the police and they send a detective over who advises her that testifying to the crime can be as horrifying as the incident itself. Mike and Archie supersede and decide that she isn't going to testify, leaving Gloria still shaken and the case unresolved. Gloria's friend George takes a break from his job at the grocery store to help Gloria home with the groceries. Archie treats him like a child because he is mentally handicapped, encouraging him to take a longer break from the store because he deserves it. When he goes back to the store, he is fired for being late, but he disappears. George's father comes calling because he is worried about him only to find that George got another job, working at the loading docks. Mike and Gloria find that they are at odds with one another over the prospect of having a baby. Gloria sees a future with children but Mike doesn't want kids because he can't bear to bring a child into the world with all of the problems, both socially and environmentally. Gloria talks to Edith who encourages her that having children is a woman's function, but Gloria decides that she needs to be a person before becoming a mother. In the end, Edith is puzzled but Archie explains that the best method is to throw Gloria's birth control pills out the window, letting them work on The Jefferson's cat instead. Louise is planning a farewell party for Henry who is moving away to start his own business. The problem is that she can't get George to attend because he won't set foot in a white man's house. So, through a mangle of miscommunication, she manages to get Edith to agree to host the party at her house. Of course, during the party Archie has to give his full opinion of the proceedings and of Henry's new venture. George reluctantly arrives to give his brother a farewell toast. Archie fears for Joey's mortal soul because he hasn't been baptized and Mike and Gloria don't want to put religion into his life. So, Archie gets the idea that while he is baptizing, that he will sneak down to the church and have it done before he gets back. Edith is completely against it, locking Archie's hat and coat in the closet and refusing to give up the key. While her back is turned, he grabs a hat and sweater out of the box that is going to the poor, grabs Joey out of his pram and runs to the church. The minister refuses to perform the baptism without the parent's consent, so Archie sneaks into the sanctuary and does it himself. Archie takes an instant dislike to Roger, a friend of Mike and Gloria, who he thinks is gay due to his effeminate manners and his love of the arts. However, Archie finds out something very interesting about a former pro-football player friend of his that causes him to re-think his ideas of who might be gay and who might be straight. Widower Jim Bowman decides to sell his house, which is next door to Archie. However, the family that Bowman sells his house to happens to be Lionel's parents, George and Louise Jefferson. Now Archie tries to get together with the rest of his neighbors to by the property from the Jeffersons before they take the first step to integrating Hauser Street. Edith goes to great lengths to conceal the fact that Archie's niece Linda has been out dancing with Lionel Jefferson. When he finds out, it ignites a firestorm between the Bunkers and the Jeffersons right in the middle of the Bunker's own living room. Linda becomes so put out with Archie's reaction that she refuses to talk to him. Lionel and George get into a huge late-night fight over Jenny and her mixed-race parents, prompting Lionel to spend the night at the Bunkers. Louise pressures her stubborn husband to apologize, and finds an unexpected ally in Archie, but only because he wants Lionel out of his hair. Lionel is getting married to a nice girl named Jenny and to celebrate the occasion, she has decided to throw an engagement party. However, in order to keep the peace, she invites Mike, Gloria and Edith but not Archie. Archie finds out about the party and assumes he's been invited. George forbids it but Archie goes anyway. The evening gets off to a bad start when Archie calls George's mother a mammy and then a full-scale war nearly breaks out when it is revealed that Jenny's parents are interracial. Finally, Archie and George share a "What is the world coming to?" toast. Archie and Edith are just settling into their blissful life after Mike and Gloria have moved to California when, out of the blue, Edith's step-cousin Floyd drops in for a visit, along with his nine year-old daughter Stephanie. Edith is glad to see them but Archie knows that it is only a matter of time before Floyd will ask for money or some other outrageous favor. He's right, the favor turns out to be that he wants Archie and Edith to look after Stephanie for two weeks (three weeks tops) while he takes care of some business. Archie refuses, against Edith's objections and Floyd and Stephanie appear to drive away, but they are surprised to find that he has left Stephanie behind. At dinner one night, Edith begins to talk about the friendship she is developing with the local butcher, Mr. Klemmer. Mike and Gloria suspect that the man may have feelings for Edith, but Archie blows it off because he believes that she has already found perfection. During a conversation at the Laundromat, Edith has a conversation with Mr. Klemmer, stating that he might have a chance. He thinks she's talking about her, but she means with someone else. She invites him over to the house for coffee and to sit around the piano and sing. She hopes Archie will join them but he goes to work at the bar, leaving him alone with the man. At the bar, Barney Hefner comes buy in tears because Blanche has just left him for their exterminator, which gets Archie's mind ticking. Back at he house, Mr. Klemmer declares for Edith but she reminds him that she is happily married, just as Archie walks in. Embarrassed over the misunderstanding, Mr. Klemmer leaves and Edith and Archie sit at the piano. Archie is in the mood for amour, but Edith wonders where she's going to get her meat from now on. Mike is upset that all of Gloria's time is spent taking care of Joey while his needs are being ignored. Gloria becomes angry and tells him that at 5 o'clock, his job ends, but that she doesn't get to punch out. They have an argument and Mike runs next door to play cards with Archie. Edith comes over to talk to Gloria and lets to know that some friction between new parents is normal with all the changes that come about, especially in the bedroom. Archie is not quite as successful in talking to Mike, but then Gloria comes over and the two share a passionate kiss. Archie and Edith take a trip uptown to attend the wedding of Carol, the daughter of Edith's cousin Maude. Archie decides to stay at the hotel rather than face either the bachelor party or the bridal shower. The focus shifts to the Finley household where Carol and David are having problems getting together on what their marriage will include. David comes home from the bachelor party after the cops raid the hotel and gets into an argument with Carol. It seems that he wants kids and has already purchased a house, but Carol doesn't want any of those things. Fueled with anger and alcohol, David begins to suspect that Carol's family hates him because he is Jewish. After a few choice words they decide to call the wedding off. Archie comes back to Maude's house and admits that he couldn't sleep because of a wild party at which he called the cops. Mike's Uncle Alex dies leaving him an inheritance of $500. Archie thinks that the money should go his way, but Mike thinks that it should go to George McGovern's presidential campaign. He does, and then secretly he starts working nights until he can get the money paid back. Gloria works herself into a frazzle trying to keep him fed and keep a lid on his story, until things come to a head and they are forced to admit to Archie what they did. When Gloria gets her paycheck in the mail, it is good news and bad news. The good news is that the check is more than she expected. The bad news is that the check also comes enclosed with a pink slip. Determined to find out why she has been fired, she and Mike pay a visit to the boss Mr. Crenshaw. Mike becomes angry and demands to know why Gloria was let go. Crenshaw is records the parts of their conversation that makes Mike look like he is threatening him, but turns it off to confesses that he fired Gloria because she is pregnant, stating that she looks like Alfred Hitchcock in drag. The smug little man assures Mike that he and Gloria can sue him but that they have no evidence. Gloria organizes a protest outside the store that is interrupted by the cops - one of whom is pregnant and joins the protest. The store, with its back to the wall, gives Gloria her job back. All of Mike's hard work pays off as he accepts a position as an associate professor, which is good news to Archie because it means that he and Gloria are finally getting out from under his roof. The problem is that finding a new home is tougher than any of them thought - even though Archie helpfully suggests that they move to Jersey, which is three hours away. George Jefferson gets wind of their problem and hatches a scheme to rent Mike and Gloria their old house right next door to Archie at a bargain basement price, just to have the satisfaction of the arrangement getting under Archie's skin. Mike and Gloria don't tell her parents about the agreement because Mike doesn't want to be living next door even when George keeps dropping the price of the rent. That night, the family gathers for a party celebrating Archie and Edith paying off the mortgage and burning the notice. Archie gets wind of the information that Mike is turning down a great deal but doesn't know that it is next door. He practically forces them to take house, but is none-too-happy with the news of the location. Gloria receives a telegram from an old college friend Debbie Ballentine announcing the birth of her sixth child. Mike doesn't remember her, but Gloria reminds him that she was the one who introduced them 9 years ago. That leads to a flashback of how Mike and Gloria met through a double date with their college roommates. Gloria was young and virginal, while Mike was a scruffy hippie who blew off a chance to protest at the Nixon inauguration. Initially they find that they hate each other, but as they begin to talk they find that they both enjoy the older style of dancing. The dance leads to a kiss, then the kiss leads to a second date. The rest is history. An explosive argument is ignited between Mike and Gloria after a Scrabble game in which Mike makes the indication that he is better at the game because he is smarter. Gloria accuses him of thinking she is inferior and goes so far as to accuse him of ruining her life by trapping her in a marriage with a kid. Mike storms out of the house and runs next door to ask if he can stay there for the night. The sleeping arrangements are tricky since Teresa is now using the extra room, leading Mike to have to sleep in the same room as Archie where his picky habits drive Archie crazy. Eventually, Mike goes back home and he and Gloria make up. On Joey's first birthday, Mike comes home with his clothes torn up and tells Gloria that, while waiting for the subway, he slipped off the platform and fell on the tracks just as the car was coming. The good news is that he was rescued by two men, the bad news is that they picked his pocket. He explains that the experience has made him aware that they both could be taken away from this world at any second and that Joey would have no one to take care of him. They discuss possible candidates to take care of him and immediately exclude Archie and Edith because Mike doesn't want Joey to grow up learning all of his grandfather's unhealthy stereotypes. When Archie and Edith come over for the party, the subject comes up and, during the argument, so does the information that Mike doesn't want Joey to be raised by Archie. Deeply hurt, they leave, vowing never to return again. At a loss for what to do, Gloria comes up with an insane proposal: They will agree not to die. Archie and Edith discover that if they don't leave provisions for who will raise Joey, then they will get custody anyway. Mike, Gloria and Archie take the subway back from the Bronx where they were going to see a house. Archie warns them about the scum and "preverts" that ride the subway even though Mike thinks dead wrong about the common man and about violence. That theory is tested when they are witness to a feuding married couple who are not only at odds with one another but are determined to drag Mike and Gloria and Archie into the middle of it. The argument gets so heated that the man attempts to strangle his wife, leading Mike to jump to the rescue. For a brief moment, Mike thinks he may have killed the man, but he eventually comes around and despite the fact that the man is okay, Mike feels horrible for giving in to his base instincts. Mike's college buddy Stewart comes over to spend the evening playing chess with him. In the middle of the game, the two delve into intellectual conversations while Gloria listens in and gives common viewpoints. Mike keeps sending her into the kitchen to get her things until eventually she gets the feeling that he doesn't want her around. Eventually, she and Mike end up in an argument because she believes that the more educated he gets, the less he will find that he needs her. Stewart helps Mike to understand how he has offended her and they make up. Mike's graduation is coming up fast and he is stressed about his final exams. Everyone is stressed except Archie who couldn't be happier because graduation would mean that he and Gloria would move out and he would finally get to convert their bedroom into a den. As a celebration, he buys a pipe and sweater and even starts trying to find a place for the goat head that Barney Hefner gave him. But his joy is undercut when Mike tells him that he has excepted a fellowship and is going to stay on at school for another year. Archie is outraged when Mike brings it upon himself to invite a friend to stay the night. Worse is that the friend is Paul, who Archie remembers as a nice, clean-cut kid with dreams of being an engineer, but is now an aimless hippie with long hair. Archie gets on his moral high-horse when he finds out that Paul has brought along his girlfriend Robin and plans to sleep with her on the Bunker's couch even though they aren't married. When Paul's friend Jeff shows up to pick him up, Jeff is not happy that Paul has brought Robin along because his father would have the same hang up about their unmarried status as Archie. Jeff breaks the deal and leaves, leaving Paul and Robin to sleep on the Bunker's couch as planned. Mike is up for a big promotion at work that would send he and Gloria to Minnesota. Archie and Edith aren't too happy. Edith is disappointed but is willing to let them live their own lives, but Archie behaves like a child and makes all kinds of rude comments about their decision. The only stumbling block between Mike and the job is that he the other candidate is a black man, and the university must hire him because they don't want any problems. The other candidate does get the job and Mike is upset. He tells the Dean that he is fine, but upon leaving, he slams the door and breaks the glass. A woman comes to the door and tells Edith that she is leaving Michael with something of his that she has had for four years: his son. The woman runs away, leaving the kid in Edith's care. He refuses to give her his name or his mother's name. When Gloria and Mike and Archie come home, they can't get an answer either. Then it all comes back to Mike when a photo is found in the kid's pocket. Seems she is Marylin Sanders, a woman that he was with some years ago for one night. This raises some issues between Mike and Gloria since he never told her about the woman. Marylin comes back and lets them know that she has had a difficult time finding a man who will accept her son, so she left him with the Bunkers hoping that she could make a go of her latest date and then introduce the kid once things had worked out. She also reveals that Mike is, in fact, not the father. Gloria enters her fourth month of pregnancy and Mike begins to have some doubts about wanting to be in the delivery room for the birth. Gloria becomes angry that he wants to back out of the delivery but he wasn't resistant to the conception, and stops talking to him for a time. Later, Edith invites Sybil Gooley over to the Stivic's so she can use an old family trick to test whether Gloria is going to have a boy or a girl (she predicts boy). Sybil and Edith discuss the birth of their children and how they wish their husbands had been there for the blessed moment. This changes Mike's mind and he decides that he wants to be present for the birth. Mike is facing final exams with anxiety so severe that it has rendered him impotent. Gloria is at a loss to help him so she turns to her mother for help. Mike is so stressed that he turns to Archie for help, hoping to acquire an older man's experience. Archie, at a loss, turns to Henry Jefferson for advice based on the theory that black people have a special secret to sexual potency. Finally, Edith comes up with the idea of simply leaving Mike and Gloria alone in the house for the evening, much to the chagrin of Archie who spends the evening in a bar watching a monster movie. During a birthday party for one of the elderly women at the nursing home, a man has a heart attack and Edith saves his life by using CPR. The man is revived and Edith is dubbed a hero. Word gets around and a local newswoman wants to put feature her as the hero of the week. When the news crew arrives, Archie thinks that the woman will be interviewing both of them. He gets in the way and the newswoman becomes rude and pushy, forcing Archie to flee the house for Kelcy's. He gets to see the interview from the television set at the bar and admits that Edith looks nice on TV. In the wake of the birth of little Joey, Gloria and Michael are at odds with one another over communication issues. Gloria is upset because Michael keeps making big and little decisions without consulting her despite the fact that their marriage is suppose to be an equal partnership. The crux of their argument is over plans for their friends who are getting married before the year ends. Problems with the arrangements cause them to lose their original location and so it is suggested that they have it in the Stivic's living room. Mike comes to understand why Gloria is upset when she re-writes the speech he was suppose to make as best man. Archie comes home irritated about a woman who asked him to put out his cigar on an elevator. He argues with Mike and Gloria about the new law about not smoking on elevators, to which Archie blows a raspberry. In a show of will-power Mike and Archie make a $20 bet. Mike agrees to give up eating for two days if Archie can give up smoking. Suspicious of each other, they sleep in the same bed and drive each other crazy. The next day they drive each other even crazier when Mike reveals all the hiding places where Archie has hidden cigars. Archie temps Mike with pudding while Mike temps Archie with smoking. Finally, Edith puts a stop to the contest by suggesting that Archie light up at the same moment that Mike takes a bite of pudding. Archie cheats and doesn't light the cigar but, while mocking Mike, karma intercedes and he burns his fingers with the match. It is never revealed whether Mike paid Archie the $20. Archie refuses to admit that he's getting older despite the signs, like the fact that he needs glasses - which he refuses - and the fact that he doesn't remember things the same way he use to. In a slump, he goes to Kelsey's bar when he meets an old acquaintance named Bill who is the same age but looks 20 years younger. Archie starts exercising but it only makes him feel worse, so he returns to Kelsy's to drown his sorrows where he meets up with Bill again and finds out that the only thing keeping him young is the fact that he cheats on his wife with young girls. When Archie meets Bill's lady friend, he isn't surprised when she lays the bombshell on him that she's an escort. George complains that Archie gave him a phony $20 bill leading to an argument not only between Archie and George, but between Edith and Louise that leaves the couples not speaking to each other. Edith and Louise make up, deciding that the only way to make their men behave is to fix the problem. So, Louise gets the idea to put a real $20 bill in Archie coat pocket so that George will think that Archie is trying to make amends. It backfires and George decides to keep it. Louise talks him out of it and the two go over to the Bunkers to settle the matter. Archie has the $20 in his hands when Mike intervenes with a long series of complicated math that has the money moving back and fourth between George and Archie and Louise and Edith and Gloria based on what everybody owes each other. Archie doesn't like the final result because all he ends up with is the phony $20 bill. Archie and Edith are having a problem with their plumbing so they call of friend of theirs who brings and assistant. While Archie is at work, the assistant tells Edith that he is a convict on a work furlough. Edith is okay with it, but she is afraid of what Archie may think. Eventually, he finds out and spreads the news all over Kelcy's bar. The plumber decides not to finish the job and that he can't use the assistant anymore. Edith encourages him not to give up. Episode #192 - Archie is caught between sympathy and self-preservation when the "other woman" from his past really needs his help. Janis Paige guest stars as Denise, the attractive waitress who was the other half of an evening that Archie - and Edith - will always remember. Barney comes into the bar still broken up over Blanche leaving him for an exterminator. Archie and Harry try and cheer him up by reminiscing, but it only reminds him of the times he had with his wife. Archie gets the idea to take his mind off Blanche by setting him up on a date with Boom Boom. Meanwhile, Blanche comes to the Bunker's house to talk to Edith because the exterminator dumped her in Atlantic City and she misses Barney again. Edith suggests that she go down to Archie's Place and try to make up with Barney. When she arrives, Boom Boom makes a hasty retreat. Despite the fact that Barney let her fish die, he and Blanche admit that they are both lonely and they make up. Archie comes home excited because while he was out driving his cab, one of his passengers was the legendary 'Sammy Davis Jr.' It seems that Mr. Davis left his briefcase in the cab and wants to come by the house to pick it up. Archie tries to keep the singer's visit under wraps but Edith can't help blabbing. First Lionel comes over, then his mother, then Barney Hefner. Finally, Sammy requests a picture with he and Archie and at the last minute kisses him on the cheek. Archie and Edith's 25 wedding anniversary is fast approaching and Edith has made elaborate (and secret) plan for she and Archie to spend a weekend in Atlantic City where they originally spent their honeymoon. Archie comes home excited because he got basketball tickets for that weekend, forcing Edith to give him the news early. Archie insists on going to the game, but Edith puts her foot down and Archie is forced to relent. They end up going to Atlantic City. Archie comes home irritated that Stretch Cunningham took a half day claiming that he was sick even though Archie knows well that he has taken time off to be with a girl. During dinner, Edith answers a phone call from one of Archie's co-workers informing her that Stretch Cunningham died at the doctor's office. While trying to get his head together, Archie gets a visit from Stretch's brother who asks Archie to give his eulogy. He reluctantly agrees and asks Mike to write something for him, but it turns out to a depressing piece of poetry. Archie writes something himself, but a shock is in store when he gets to the funeral and finds out that Stretch (whose real name is Jerome) was actually Jewish. Archie gets an elaborate gift from Eddie Frazier an old Army buddy who has made himself a millionaire. When Archie finds out that he is in New York, he invite him and the rest of his old platoon over to the house for a reunion. Mike resents the man's wealth, questioning what he has done for his fellow man, that he is selfish and thoughtless. During the party, Mike overhears Eddie's telephone conversation with his son and learns that he is estranged from his family. Realizing that Eddie is a man with only material wealth but no family, he refuses to tell Archie. Archie gets ready to have a booming business at the bar on Super Bowl Sunday. He has packed sandwiches, bought a projection television, and plans to keep shoveling beer down the customer's throats all night long - even if he has to cheat them to do it. During the festivities, however, two guy drop in that no one seems to know. They plan to rob the place just as the tabs are being collected. Their plan goes off without a hitch and even the added humiliation of having everyone in the bar drop their pants so they can make a clean getaway. In order to catch up on some of the bills, Archie and Edith decide to rent out the spare guest room. The best qualified candidate turns out to be Teresa Betancourt the smart-alack Puerto Rican nurse that checked Archie into the hospital when he had his surgery. She warns Archie and Edith that she has a boyfriend with a hot temper who is looking for her, and when a man comes looking for her, Archie assumes it is the boyfriend and when he tries to get past him, he slugs the guy in the stomach. It turns out that the man is really her brother and that she is touched that Archie would defend her like that. The family is getting ready for Gloria's birthday, unfortunately it just happens to coincide with the first day of her period. She comes home moody and almost immediately gets into an argument with Archie over his view of women as inferior. The argument ends with her calling her father stupid. Edith tries to talk to her about it, but Gloria blames her for always giving in to his insults and his demands. The two go to bed that night not talking to one another. Edith can't sleep and can't talk about it. Gloria is stubborn and won't back down until her mother realizes that she has been little more than a doormat. Mike and Gloria can't sleep and end up in a major fight that goes from the bedroom to the living room to the couch. The fight goes on and on until Edith brings it to a halt with a story of how her mother and father got into a fight over maple syrup and didn't talk for several weeks, after which they never really patched things up. Mike and Gloria decide on a truce. Archie is excited when a real estate agent wants to buy his house for a huge profit. He figures it is a good deal because he and the family move out to California to stay with a rich relative while looking for a place to live. When the agent comes by the house, he offers Archie $35,000 and Mike alerts him that the man is a Blockbuster, a scam artist who exploits the owners' fears of lower prices if racial minorities live in the area. Archie doesn't believe him and is ready to sign away the house. Edith becomes very vocal and refuses to give in to a situation that she thinks will see her family selling all of their precious memories. Archie won't listen until Bertha drops in to tell him that the supposedly rich relative in California is flat broke and that the family would be living in his garage. Archie changes his mind and rushed out the door to warn the neighbors. Episode #150 - The Bunker's unexpected return from a weekend trip puts Edith in a precarious situation when she discovers that Teresa has her boyfriend in her bedroom. Edith and the embarrassed Teresa agree that the only course of action is to try to sneak out the visitor before Archie finds out. Archie's union finally negotiates a contract with his company that the workers ratify. When Mike finds out the terms - a flat pay rate for the next three years - he tells Archie that his union should have turned down the offer and started to fight for a cost-of-living escalator, especially with the onset of sky-high inflation. Archie, however, is just glad the strike has ended. Edith is lonely and decides to answer a magazine ad for a couple to be friends with. She invites them over for dinner without telling Archie. The couple, Curtis and Ruth Remply seem friendly - too friendly. It takes Louise Jefferson to explain to Edith that the Remplys are actually swingers and not just on the dance floor. While doing the family's laundry at the laundromat, a man walks up to Edith and starts pouring ketchup all over the clothes. Edith is shocked and infuriated until she realizes that the man is secretly auditioning her for a detergent commercial. She gets the job, which will pay $250 whether she does the commercial or not. Archie is not happy, especially since the man ruined the shirt he got from Disney World (signed by Mickey Mouse), but is happy with the prospect of the money. However, during the commercial shoot, Edith is asked which pile of laundry looks cleaner and keeps choosing the other brand because she is too honest to tell a lie even for money. The director cancels the commercial and Archie is flummoxed because it means that no residuals will be coming. It's Christmas again and the Bunker's are preparing for their holiday meal with Archie's buddy Pinky. Mike's old friend David Brewster drops by unexpectedly and Mike is concerned because he is a draft dodger who has been living in Canada and is wanted by the FBI. Pinky comes by and Archie warns the family not to let him move the conversation toward his son Steven since Pinky is still in shock over his tragic death in Vietnam. During dinner Archie won't stop quizzing him about why he lives in Canada. David is so put out that he admits that he is a draft dodger, which insights a furious rage from Archie. He assumes that since Pinky, the "gold star father", has lost his son in Vietnam that he will join him in his outrage, but to Archie's shock, Pinky sides with David and wishes him a Merry Christmas. Dealing with the shock of this turn of events, Archie tells the family that he needs time to work this out. He goes to the door and tells a group of carolers that he doesn't want to have to call the cops on them. The slams the door, shaking a wreath embossed with a single word: "Peace." Election Day is coming and Archie is at odds with Mike over which candidate is most qualified for the job, mainly because Mike's choice is a woman named Claire Packer. Mike is shocked to learn that Archie is choosing not to vote, and in arriving at the polls, Edith is shocked to learn that he isn't even registered and that he hasn't voted since 1960. Suddenly desperate to get his vote out, Archie tries encourage Edith to cast her vote for his choice rather than her own. Archie discovers too late that Edith forgot to mail the insurance check and today is the last day of the grace period. He leaves her birthday dinner to get to the insurance office to put it under the door, but on the way up the elevator stops, leaving him trapped with a snooty black man, a dingy secretary, a Puerto Rican janitor and his pregnant wife. The secretary goes into hysterics, the wife goes into labor, the black man won't shut up about his wealth, the janitor has to defend himself against stereotypical remarks and Archie offends everyone with his opinions. He makes a myriad of jokes at the expense of the janitor but when the baby is actually born the event softens his heart. Meanwhile, Edith, back at the restaurant takes a liking to the wine and gets bombed out of her mind. Archie is angry when Edith invites Henry and Louise Jefferson over for dinner, especially on the night he was suppose to go to The Mets game, but most especially because they are black. He reluctantly agrees even after canceling on the phony claim that Edith has a sprained ankle. Before dinner, Archie and Henry get into a heated debate over racial matters including the color designation of God, which gets so angry that Henry threatens to leave. Louise defuses the situation by admitting that Henry is actually her brother-in-law and that her husband George refused to come over because he didn't want to have dinner with white people. Henry drops an even bigger bombshell when he tells Archie that George went to see The Mets. Later Edith confesses to Mike and Gloria that Archie hated Mrs. Jefferson's food so much that he had three helpings. Mike brings home a game called Group Therapy which asks players to open up about certain private feelings. He invites Lionel and the Lorenzos over the play, but the game turns out to be less fun then he had planned when he begins acting childish about everyone's reaction to him. He accuses everyone of criticizing him just as harshly as Archie. Edith straightens him out by explaining that Archie doesn't hate him but criticizes him because he sees in Mike all the things that he can never be. Archie comes home completely oblivious to what is going on. Mike says he understands and hugs him. Archie's problems come crashing down on him during one hectic day. First Edith gets a letter stating that their insurance has been canceled. Her nephew informs them that this is due to the crime in the area where they live which puts them in the high risk category due to low-income black families who have moved into the area. Then, Archie is given the unhappy task of having to fire an employee at work, and must decide whether or not to fire a lazy white man or a black man or a Puerto Rican man who are hard workers. He decides to fire the Puerto Rican man who takes his firing with good humor because it means that he is left with the lazy man to do his job. Four years after moving on Hauser Street and tolerating Archie's racial barbs, George and Louise decide to move to finally move on up to the east side of Manhattan into a luxurious apartment to be closer to his new dry cleaning store located in the same building.

He gets the job over a man who is highly educated but has been out of work for three years. The man is so distraught that he climbs out onto the ledge of the building and threatens to jump, with only Archie to talk him down.

The man sees the light and crawls back in, leaving Archie on the ledge by himself.

As the booze soak in they begin to talk, mostly about why Archie is so prejudice against people who are different. Mike is stunned when Archie reveals not only taunting from his classmates over the fact that he had to wear one shoe and one boot, thus giving them the nickname "Shoobootie", but that his father was a very abusive man who corrected Archie by hitting him and locking him in the closet for days at a time. Yet, Archie defends his father none-the-less. Finally, Archie passes out on the floor and Mike, who is still stunned, covers him with the tarp and wishes "Shoobootie" a good night.

Robert James, an entertainment reporter for a local Los Angeles television station whose best friend is also his publicist, the three-time divorced Dirk. Robert is handsome, smart and a thoroughly modern man in his thinking, as he should be, considering his romantic and parental entanglements. On the verge of finalizing his divorce from the somewhat self-absorbed Neesee, the mother of their endearing five-year-old son, Bobby, Jr., he is madly in love with Tia, a funny, clever kindergarten teacher. This humorous and heartwarming comedy is a fresh, timely look at many young parents' new, compassionate attitude toward how divorced parents raise their children together. Robert, Tia and Neesee are outraged to find out that Bobby is lost in the basketball stadium after when Robert broke Bobby's promise about taking him to a basketball game and spending some time with him, which then causes Robert, Tia and Neesee to have a serious argument. When Bobby's rambunctious behavior is diagnosed as Attention Deficit Disorder, Robert is convinced he can help his son without therapy. Meanwhile, believing that his marriage to Jonelle is on its last legs, Dirk concocts an elaborate scheme so that she won't find out his true net worth. When Jonelle throws him out, Dirk crashes on Robert and Tia's couch causing them to get sucked into their best friends' break-up. Meanwhile, Neesee co-chairs a school fund raiser with another very competitive mother, who unexpectedly winds up being the perfect business partner for her. When Robert starts to get attention as a correspondent on "Entertainment Tonight" his rising celebrity status and swelling ego begin to rub everyone the wrong way. Meanwhile, Neesee starts to question her relationship with Rusty when she realizes her champagne tastes may be too much for him to handle. When Neesee nurses ailing Robert and Bobby Jr. back to health, Robert gets to see a more caring and nurturing side of his ex-wife, which brings back all of the old feelings he had when he first fell in love with her. Later, when Tia sees an ugly side to her new boyfriend Rick, she realizes she is still in love with Robert and wants to reconcile, only to find out that Robert now needs space. After finally reconciling with Robert, Tia is floored when a guilt-ridden Robert confesses that he almost shared a kiss with Neesee, leaving Tia irritated, so when Robert tries to be all lovey-dovey with her, she resists and they find themselves working out their issues at Dirk and Jonelle's wedding. Later, Neesee sees a therapist to work out her issues with men and discovers that her non-existent relationship with her father may be the root of her problems. Bobby's lying leads to a lecture from Robert, Tia and Neesee. But Bobby has no trouble being truthful at a dinner party celebrating one month of marriage for Dirk and Jonelle, which leads Tia and Robert in hot water with the newlyweds. Meanwhile, Neesee takes her therapist's advice and decides to work out her unresolved issues with her estranged father Roger. Now that they're living together, Robert and Tia worry that during Bobby Jr's increasingly frequent overnight stays he may have actually witnessed them having sex, and to make matters worse, they believe that Bobby Jr. has drawn a picture of what he saw and fear that he may show it to his mother Neesee. Meanwhile, Neesee starts a catering business. When Tia's dad Lucas joins the family for Thanksgiving dinner, he is immediately taken by Neesee's mom Kate and spends the entire meal flirting with her, while she wants nothing to do with him. Later, after Bobby ignores his parents' orders twice, they decide they must punish him with his first spanking - but neither of them can follow through. Tia tries to explain why she needs some space, Robert successfully seduces her, thinking their problems are solved only to be disappointed the next morning when Tia tells him nothing has changed. But when Neesee attempts to get Robert and Tia back together, her plan backfires, not realizing that she is the reason for their separation. Later, when Jonelle decides to take Tia out to take her mind off of the separation, Robert shows up at the club and begs Tia to reconsider, only to find her being hit on by an annoying guy named Hale. When Robert accepts an offer from his bosses at "Entertainment Tonight" to pay for his wedding for the right to televise it on their show, Tia regrets his decision when the advertising and promotions become more important than the bride and groom. Later, Robert feels bad when he learns that "Mr. LA" is in jeopardy of being canceled and contemplates leaving "Entertainment Tonight" to help his old show. As Bobby's basketball coach, Robert must turn the other cheek during a game on a boisterous heckling father in order to teach his son a lesson. Meanwhile, Jonelle gets mad when Dirk wants to buy an expensive plasma TV without consulting her. Neesee invites Robert on an all-expenses-paid trip to attend her mother's second marriage ceremony in the Turks and Caicos Islands. When Robert and Neesee make an unexpected stop in a small town, they are mistaken for pop stars Beyonce and Jay-Z. Later, Neesee and Robert make a decision about a second baby that could alter their relationship forever. When Robert and Neesee decide to have dinner to discuss the romantic spark between them, their initial flirtatious behavior turns catty as old habits begin to surface, reminding them why they got divorced in the first place. Meanwhile, Jonelle is making Dirk crazy with all of the wedding plans. Joe Zee - Creative Director for Elle - is always one step ahead of the trends.

This just may be their last chance to transform cutting room concepts into rack ready fashions. The Swiftboys may be called All Stars in the title, this nowhere, North Holland amateur soccer team consists of boys who since childhood enjoy the game itself -only gay captain Bram, a lawyer, takes the trouble to spend time on official club business- less then the camaraderie as none has the making of anything resembling a star player, to put it kindly, so they usually end their season by demotion. The point is having fun on the field, in the locker-room, in the canteen, and whenever something happens in one's life one or more of the others are likely to get involved, which also goes for some players' female partners, while male bonding seems only to stimulate their flirtatious lust. The chairman is a cigar-smoking fat rat, who intends to exploit the various teams using his infrastructure, and comes to employ as barmaid ex-con Nadja, a red-hair harpy nevertheless considered sexy by most straight boys. Once again, Mark has cheated on Roos. This time he double-crossed her with her own mother! Mark thinks that Roos is now seeing someone else and although Willem, Peter, Johnny and Paul feel it's his own fault, Bram and Hero want to help him. They try to find out who it is Roos is seeing and find Roos in a cafï¿½ with Dutch soccer celebrity Danny Blind. Once more only ten other players turn up, so Bram plays despite a hurt ankle- and wounds it so badly he must be taken to ER, for which only Mark volunteers, in order to dodge Roos's monthly 'shopping Sunday', a desertion she doesn't forgive... Bram's pain turns into bliss when he exchanges loving glances with sweet, hunky male nurse Henri, an ideal dating partner he soon shares the bed with. Meanwhile Berrie and Johny come up with a 'golden' idea: a Big Brother-like TV format on the team, 'Big Soccer', which Paul suggests to spike with some nude they would like to see: nasty Nadja in the shower, so they willingly soil her, but have trouble with the hidden cameras the greedy chairman permitted them to install, a job alas left to bumblers Johnny and Nemo... One of the Swiftboys' Sunday football pleasures is verbally abusing the referee, but this time a member of the Dutch Soccer League's disciplinary committee actually takes offense to their reported use of terms like son of a whore and blind queer, so - he has a blind, gay twit delivered by his ma, a cheap hooker, for their next match against nice farm-boys. No harm is done although the entire game happens literally behind the ref's back, except by him, he literally gets lost, in the mote and caught in a net. Antillian Paul, who was ridiculed ruthlessly by the mates for his temporary spectacles, takes polite pity of the bumbler, but is horrified to find it's also a blatant racist, but his sneaky 'revenge' in kind goes wrong... The chairman finally sends the dodo off the field, but then ma arrives, with an embarrassing memory for faces... After an office row with his boss, Mark impulsively gives his notice and decides to start his own firm: delivering breakfasts on bed, ordered by Internet. Roos's suspicions about his managerial skills prove justified, as he convinces his two unemployed soccer mates to become his bumbling, yet paid deliverers, as Nemo can't stay awake in the morning and test client Peter experiences the hard way Johnny has a worse bedside manner then a charging rhinoceros. Nevertheless when bitchy ex-con Nadja is hired in the inept duo's place, their mates all consider this treason demanding pay-back, so Berrie thinks one up which starts with copying Mark's credit card number.... The mates go to Bram's home when none was called as usual, and discover a birthday party is going on, in a style making clear they didn't know in 15 years he's actively gay. After grudgingly coming to terms with Bram's former closet gay-silence, they get another surprise; the party was a surprise from his new boy-friend, Philip, who rides an equally beautiful horse and has an almost magical way with wives, pets, even the soccer mates themselves are soon all won over by his charm and helpful gifts like 'bunny whispering', but Bram feels Philip joining the soccer team would invade an established vital part of his life... Gentleman Peter made the fatal mistake to live together with overbearing hag Maartje, who just threw another tantrum over a futility and literally trashed his compulsively neat apartment, yet when she apologizes he offers her a lift to her mother's. Snooping in his car she finds out a packet containing a beauty-case, which Bram made him buy on sale as birthday gift for ex-con Nadja, who meanwhile pretty literally throws the other mates' flirtatious gifts back in their faces, gross as always- then locks them out in their underwear and takes off by motorbike, soon bumping into Roos, who is pissed-off after finding the edible lingerie Mark packed for Nadja. Maartje draws all the wicked wrong conclusions, as if poor Peter were a sordid philanderer, steals his car keys and locks him in it. The other angry goats gang up, and come up with a way to really hurt him: vandalizing his beloved car. Thanks to Nadja's ankle tracking device, the Swift boys locate her and catch up... The girls and Bram's gay partner Ben prepare an original, major celebration as the swift Boys are finally about to play champion, unless they lose badly in the last game- alas against the ruffian Poldervogels, who recur to giant Henk again as secret weapon. So sweet but utterly inept Nemo is lied to it's a home-game, yet by the time he finds the out-field is hoped for as mates were carried off injured massively. Meanwhile the chairman has heard he may be personally held liable for damages caused by the club, and decides to sell it, so he shows off the 'future champions' to popular singer Andrï¿½ Hazes, a former member. The Swift Boys' loss that day is just not enough to decide the title either way, so it comes to penalties... As if the Swiftboys weren't depressed enough by the fact it's their last match for the season, their girls and Bram's gay mate Henri pay them no attention, being coached by the chairman for a sports feat of their own: participating in the annual Rotterdam marathon. On the assumption 'athletes' must be fitter by definition, the ever-bumbling boys decide to enter last-minute themselves, but it soon becomes clear their utter lack of training or planning means that Paul, who betted on them against feminist Nadja, and is already on crutches after an equally ill-considered attempt to taunt the 'sissies' barefoot and baring all, is bound to loose cash and face while his overconfident mates regroup in infirmary as such or after disqualifying themselves otherwise... Now Willem died between the goal posts, Peter and Mark interview potential new keepers, without much luck, so Peter invests in professional equipment- alas he proves even less gifted then Willem... Meanwhile gay Bram tries to keep Willem's garden center running, with rather inept help from friendly philosopher Hero -who feels too tenderly for the 'sensitive' plants- and Paul -who gives Dutch arithmetics an even worse name- but also discovers he's the unexpected ideal surrogate for Willem's offspring and even for widow Anja, which Mark soon guesses. Anja considers returning to Suriname, Bram even switching careers from his law firm to her garden center... Bram is startled his ma wants to hire his legal services- to divorce his dear dad, which she says 'came out of the closet' after 35 years of respectable marriage, yet Bram counsels not to rush things. The soccer boys wouldn't listen to chairman Joop Van Riethoven, but the hormones-held hounds sit up when he makes parole-con Nadja order them to turn up Sunday looking their best for a potential new sponsor- Mr. Van Zon, who runs a solarium. Johnny and Nemo eagerly go claim free tan-treatments, but refusing to let really rude bitch Nadja go first proves a peculiarly painful mistake... Bram's dad Theo asks to stay with him, being kicked out at home, only now learns about ma's divorce project and accepts to resume his experience as the Swiftboys' trainer and as referee, but Bram scolds him for groping his cheerfully ignorant mates without outing himself; alas when Theo does it's much queerer then Bram himself, and embarrassing, but dad demands the same loyalty as he showed all Bram's happy youth long... The chairman has no luck finding an experienced volunteer to train a new soccer team- until the Swift boys' horny ears hear the words 'girls team' - suddenly they fall all over each-other for the job, which is wisely given to gay captain Bram, but when he is prevented by court business, Johnny and Berrie -who even turned down three paying driving school clients- both take the field, to dazzle the girls with a nasty display of dirty tricks. A black female referee says soccer is a man's game, so no sissy wining about the adversaries painful knocks and kicks even right under her nose, yet Johnny manages to make her draw a red card- so the violent coward gives poor gentleman Peter's name; being innocent, he calls all mates as witnesses at the formal sanction proceedings at the Dutch soccer league KNVB, including Johnny, who believed it to be about another matter... When both boys - and girls team are without competition adversary, the chairman organizes them to take the field, under the eyes of the jealous wives, and in flirtatious top-scorer Mark's case that means the mean tricks used by the girls players are followed by his own sweetheart Roos's, heartlessly and hardly sweet... The soccer team needs a substitute referee but can't find anyone, so drawing lots decides on ruffian Johnny, who proves extremely tough on his bumbling mates, who are unamused- until he brutally punishes opponent Van Lieshout's insult 'blind queer' by KO head-but. Van Lieshout brings his injury and concussion in court. Bram accepts to defend the power-abusing hooligan. Paul has started a career as party clown- alas amusing no children, and arrives as 'crown witness' in costume after proceedings which mainly accumulated anger with the presiding judge over Bram's inexperience in criminal matters, with a for some amusing outcome... When he learns the team is celebrating its '75th lustrum' (actually a 5-yearly anniversary), Johhny decides to organize a lottery with Nemo, permitted by the chairman provided the club gets 75% of the profits. Johhny's plan is to be stingy on prizes, but on top of inexperience and his un-Dutch poor commercial flair -Nemo has some sales talent, no drive- they lack capital to actually purchase any prizes, so they only present photos of the prizes they intend to buy once the profits are in, but don't sell nearly enough tickets, the cheapest of which are fl.50, just too expensive for most players and supporters.... The team has found a new player, Berrie, a driving instructor with a heavy southern accent and laid-down mentality. The chairman eagerly installs a notice for his private parking spot, which is cheerfully ignored by the players, but also by a posh outsider, Barrie Mens, chairman of an exclusive golf club which is moving into the neighboring land, but crushes his foot to make the 'suit' move his superior car. The Swift Boys are startled to find a soccer league program got the Poldervogels to anglicize their name into Lowland Birds and turn sissy. The chairman first enlists the boys to chase the golfers, cursing when they seem to fraternize instead, but by the time they're brushed off Nadja has changed his mind, as rich neighbors spell rich pickings... Hid widow Anja tells Willem's last wish is to have his ashes distributed over the 'holy grass' at Duch premier league club PSV, so the Swift Boys head for Eindhoven, in the southern province Northern Brabant. They manage to get in masquerading as some of PSV's newly recruited foreign players, but first get lost in the huge stadium, then can't get Willem's urn open and when they finally have a tool... Back home, Nemo manages in one day to loose the ball, forget about the gas so his home burns down and cause the glass cups display window to fall to pieces; ruffian Johny takes his mate in, helps him make a new display case and makes a cocky pass at whorish club canteen waitress Nadja, who keeps him in check by blatant threats of genital mutilation, yet falls for gentle Nemo and his weed, even agreeing to take their cloths off, which reveals her to be an ex-con under electronic surveillance... After a soccer game, the Swift Boys are taking a shower when suddenly two American drug dealers burst in, threatening to shoot them if they don't tell them where 'fat boy' is. The Swift Boys explain Willem is dead. The drug dealers say they've made a deal with Willem that has gone awry and that they now want their money (half a million dollar) back. Nemo slowly starts to remember how this deal came about and explains in long flashbacks. It's that time of the year when captain Bram must call everyone to 'remind' them of paying for membership, while they wine about receiving the club newsletter. When the chairman insists to get the whole arrear paid before the Swiftboys are allowed to play, just now they have their first chance ever to win a season against their arch-rivals the Poldervogels, Peter is prepared to advance the small fortune. Willem has a weekend from hell: his wife Anja hounds him not just in their garden center as usual but insists he keeps his promise to drive her and their offspring to the beach, despite the horrible traffic cue; once there, he can't handle missing out on the crucial game, and cycles all the way back. The mates were agreeing to chuck the soccer in altogether, but Willem refuses to see all his sacrifices go wasted, and plays the game of his life, only not just the way he meant... Captain Bram phones around to the soccer teammates for a substitute player that day, but nobody has a suggestion, so they must accept the eager offer of Johnny's cousin Roy, who proves less inept at the sport then they, but also tyrannical, fanatical and violent, slapping and kicking his own mates for 'incompetence', even holding guns to the referee's head and telling Suriname player Paul, who just adopted his 'pre-enslavement name' Poli-poli as 'heir of mighty medicine-men', so they try his supposed hereditary voodoo-power to chase the brute pricking pins into Bram's Barbie-doll, but... Peter is tricked by foxy younger colleague Tineke Robertson into driving her home, checking for burglars, choosing a color, zipping her dress, bringing her bag to find her naked and willing, but runs away to Mark, who hates being forced by Rose into role-playing each-other as marriage therapy and sees no problem in encouraging cheerful infidelity, even goes so far as to invite her to the club. Nemo is prepared for his drivers test by roommate Johnny and professional instructor Berrie, but can only control his test-stress with weed, which works at the theory exam, but causes a crash at the practical. He also plays a part in allowing hag Maartje to surprise innocent Peter naked with vamp Tineke all over him in the showers, however... Despite standing in line for six hours, Bram failed to get England-Holland cup match tickets, so the Swift Boys ask the chairman a meeting with a black market trader, but they turn his offer down when hearing Wim's wife Anja has won six VIP tickets in a radio contest. Alas she intends to take only gay Filip and four 'other' soccer wives, causing the boys to try flattery, soccer quizzes and fury, all in vain: Wim has to apologize and pay double again, then bid against their own chairman which ups the price to 1,0OO guilders, a dirty trick. Wim gives the girls a ride but switches the tickets, yet the boys get a cold shower and manage to make it even worse... When Nemo tells his new girlfriend Renï¿½e wants him to keep his hands to himself till they know each-other better but is all over his body, they suppose it must be a cross-dresser. Mark feels a wreck without sex or a job, but revives when the club is visited by Austrian producer-director Romek Spandau, who is looking for healthy Dutch jocks as actors, 1,5000 Euros an hour. Mark, Peter, Berrie and Johnny are selected but hesitate when Berrie remembers the Tyrolian is famous for porn, accept though hearing Nadia is among the female cast. On the set however, watched by Bram and suspicious Roos from outside, the four are joined by the fat chairman and find out the script is not at all what they expected... The Swiftboys are startled to get invitations for nurse Henri's wedding to Abraham Jozef Rood, i.e. their gay captain Bram. Mark only meant it as a sarcasm, but the others decide the appropriate attention is to cross-dress as female singers, e.g. the right wig turns Peter into a credible Nana Mouskouri. When their car breaks down on the way to the party hall, where Bram's Uncle Jan's speech stirs both laughter and a family feud till a fist-fight ensues, the boys refuse to call for professional help, fearing to become a national laughing-stock, so they try their thumbs- alas, that attracts the attention of the feared Polderboys... Ultimately they all join the celebrations, where Mark finds he's imitating the only real singer, Willeke Alberti, even makes a pass at her as 'accidentally guy boy ready to be cured by a real girl'. Bram and Henri find solving their problem who should wear the 'female' wedding ring by daring tongue piercings a particularly painful mistake... Nemo's unemployment allowance is cut after proof of cohabitation is found, the soccer mates only pretend to give him job advice and application training. Peter finds lazy Nemo's natural talent: medical guinea-pig, for which house-mate Johny believes to be lazy enough too. Roos's 'interest injection therapy' makes her shout at the soccer mates by the field, to their anger and some physical pain, and forces Mark to wast words on her body just when soccer is on TV, but the anatomical truth isn't appreciated at all, so he also comes sleep in the test clinic. The trio enjoys lying in bed pampered by nurses, but soon discover they're not just stripped for sponge-baths but subjected to painful rear-medication, waxing, skin-irritants... Being forbidden to leave for weekly soccer, the louts decide to escape... Roos is seeing therapist Fokke because she feels neglected by Mark. She forces Mark to visit Fokke with her; having seen Mark, Fokke feels he has to take a closer look at Mark's soccer friends. After observing a game and the aftermath, Fokke concludes Mark is trapped in a macho culture and suggests that Mark, the chairman, Johnny and Nemo play korfball, a mixed sport for a change, to break away from the macho culture that is soccer.

In an English town, the choir master's personal musical ambition and crush for the new soprano drive him to blow up his marriage (with children) for her. Mother and mentally handicapped son Peter suddenly find themselves abandoned and almost accidentally start an rival choir. The community is soon divided, including the sentiments of the old reverend and his sassy young parish assistant, whose past is one of several further complications.
null Every year the Glossop Choir come second in the annual choral contest and this year they aim to come first.Choir master Michael Caddick sees his chance when glamorous soprano Layla joins their ranks, walking out on his long-suffering wife Esther, the previous leading lady, to feature her as star soloist and to be with her. But Esther has the last laugh when she enters her talented, autistic teen-aged son Kyle and his rock band All the Small Things in the contest. The presence of herself and several of her friends as back-up singers make up the required number of entrants and they carry off the prize. The young curate Jake - who appears to have a history with Layla - and most of Esther's friends are on their side. But Michael declares musical war on his wife. Michael aims to enter the choir for the North West choral heats, holding auditions which exclude some loyal members, notably "Shrek", the fat, simple caretaker, who has a beautiful voice but is nervous of singing in public. Michael moves in with Layla but she still throws herself at Jake who plainly came to Glossop to escape from her and who is unimpressed. He is a tower of strength to Esther and they give the church a new lease of life, opening it to non-believers, to the horror of the ghastly, arch-conservative Mr. and Mrs. Tonks. Layla puts the boot in on Shrek, who goes missing, but Kyle finds him and recruits him to the ever-increasing All the Small Things, now incorporating Michael's rejects, who are even supported by the doddery old vicar. Gilbert Tonks is doubly outraged when Michael gives his customary solo to talented young Serb chorister Nemanja and Jake, anxious to create a community centre in the church,gives his over-priced decorating tender also to Nemanja. When Tonks, his snooty wife and their airhead satellite Lulu Pryke try to bully the lad and his older girlfriend Sofija into resigning, it is inevitable that the couple will embrace All the Small Things. Not only is Michael's choir decreasing but he has cause to query Layla's stability when she buys him a matching white dog and baby grand piano. With the newly-wed Radics gone, Michael's choir is struggling, somewhat to the amusement of reluctant accompanist Monica, so Ethel Tonks, having declared the Serbs' church art designs as "sacriligious",brings her relatives in as reinforcements. Olive, Esther's best friend and a prime mover in the breakaway group, enters All the Small Things for the North West choral heats, where they do well, despite Layla's efforts to sabotage their transport, and even Michael is impressed. He is less enamoured of Layla's insistence that they start a family of their own and Georgia, the only child to show loyalty to her father, berates him for leaving her mother for such a stupid bimbo. However, Olive is starting to bond with fellow ageing rebel Jimmy, as is Esther with Jake. After Monica's brother Edgar, an ageing rocker, drops down dead at his 60th birthday bash, it is revealed that Monica and Ethel are actually sisters,who have barely spoken to each other in twenty years and, whilst Ethel inevitably demands a conventional funeral, Edgar's last wish is for a hard rock ceremony. Monica holds the ace card by divulging that she and Gilbert were once lovers, and Edgar's wishes are honoured. Ethel acquires some dignity with her acceptance of all this but Layla's 'family' dinner party goes awry when Michael defends Kyle's faddy eating habits. Esther rebuffs Jake's sincere advances before he tells her that he is Layla's brother. Jake is upset when Esther berates him for not explaining before that Layla was his sister and the vicious Layla, failing to gain Jake's sympathy, sends an anonymous letter, exposing her brother's former alcoholism. Ethel and Gilbert want him sacked but, after a hung vote, the not so dusty vicar persuades Layla to redeem herself and save Jake's job. Grace and Kyle run away and Esther and Michael locate them at an old holiday haunt - Michael wants reconciliation but Esther explains that she is now a free woman. At the choir finals Esther is shocked when All the Small Things try to sabotage Michael's singers by heckling them, fleeing to a station platform, where her choir, and Jake, join her for a rousing performance of Beethoven's Ode to Joy.

Through all of this, Dad knows better than to interfere, and just keeps out of the fray. The classic comic strip, "Dennis the Menace," was created by Hank Ketcham.

Mahler's turbulent loves are expressed through his music. His settings of poems by Friedrich Rï¿½ckert explore themes of love, nature, and otherworldliness. Mahler was haunted throughout his life by the premonition of his own death. The first movement of his 2nd Symphony draws stark contrasts between the composer's premonition of doom and his vision of life. Modern parallels can be found in "Adieu" by Bernard Rands and "Of Paradise and Light" by his wife, composer Augusta Read Thomas The legendary impresario Serge Diaghilev of Les Ballets Russes commissioned from Stravinsky and Ravel some of the greatest music for the ballet.

The dramatic brass fanfares that for Tchaikovsky symbolized Fate find a modern echo. Music has sometimes reflected and at other times challenged repressive ideologies. Shostakovich abandoned the premiere of his challenging 4th Symphony for fear of reprisals from the Stalinist government. His triumphant 5th Symphony was next, and the authorities were pleased. To this day, the 5th is Shostakovich's most popular symphony. What is its message? What does "political music" mean today? Robert Schumann's wife, Clara, was herself a gifted pianist and composer. She became a lifelong friend and source of inspiration for Schumann's protï¿½gï¿½, Johannes Brahms.

After discovering that his rival classmate Joel Zadak has a girlfriend, Allen Gregory sparks a sex tape scandal with Principal Gottlieb. To help Allen's adopted sister Julie appear "normal," Richard and Jeremy hire cool-looking kids to hang out with her. Allen Gregory's teacher Gina seeks to teach him a lesson on racism after he mistakes his Hispanic schoolmate Guillermo for a janitor. Much to Gina's dismay, Allen Gregory produces a play to depict his point of view of the incident. Meanwhile, Richard hires Jeremy as his new maid. When Allen Gregory's doting - and comically malevolent - dad Richard helps plan Allen's first school dance, tension occurs when popular stud Joel Zadak invites Allen's trusty friend, Patrick and not Allen Gregory. Meanwhile, jealousy sparks when Richard's life partner Jeremy gets a job as a D.J. at Kirby's Roller Bowl. When Joel Zadak stays home from school because he's sick, the always presumptuous Allen Gregory steps in to help his popular "friend" by keeping tabs on the clique. As Allen Gregory gains some ground with the exclusive group, Zadak loses more than his friends. Meanwhile, Richard hits the boardroom at his father's company. Allen Gregory enlists the help of a friend to find his biological mother. Though Allen Gregory initially dreams of his mother and father falling in love and starting a life together, he soon realizes that this new "family" is not all it's cracked up to be. Since his family has fallen on hard times, Allen Gregory De Longpre, one of the most pretentious 7-year olds of our time, is forced to face his greatest challenge - attending elementary school. His mature ways make it hard for him to fit in and his struggle to adjust is not limited to his classmates. As Allen Gregory makes his rounds with the faculty, his first meeting with his much-older principal takes a special turn.

In this hard to imitate format, former sports reporter Mark Uytterhoeven, arguably Flanders' greatest comical TV talent, and a varying panel of celebrities make fun, in many different ways, by comments, parodies, doctored texts and images etc., of recent programs on Flemish national TV (both VRTs own and its commercial rivals), hence the title meaning "All can (be done) better". Nobody is spared: actors, presenters, reporters, politicians, script, camera-work, editing, even publicity; besides actual faults, they can be made the butt of a joke that sprouts from the panel's vicious imagination, e.g. quoting out of context or re-editing. While looking into the theft of several precious artifacts, Alleyn is called to investigate a murder of Charles Rankin at a gathering that includes Agatha Troy, his girlfriend. Rankin had brought a precious dagger to the event. Complicating things further is that Troy is close to these people and resents some of Alleyn's questioning. A parallel and inter-related crime for Alleyn is to identify the art thieves. After an artist's model dies in a suspicious incident, the aristocratic Detective Chief Inspector Alleyn and his down-to-earth assistant Inspector Fox, investigate. Matters get complicated with a houseful of suspects, blackmail, another death, and Alleyn's growing attraction to the painter Agatha Troy. Emily Pride, Alleyn's cantankerous old French teacher, is the landlord of Portascarrick, an idyllic Scottish island with Pixie Falls, a small waterfall, which, according to local Celtic tradition, holds healing powers and can render miraculous cures. Some of the locals have vested financial interests in commercializing it and turning it into a mystical health spa. Miss Pride is dead set against the development and warns local merchant Elspeth Cost and others involved in the project that it must stop or their leases will be terminated. When she starts to receive death threats for her opposition,she asks her old pupil for help... and a gun. After an evening of darts and vintage brandy, a distinguished, although amorous, barrister succumbs to rigor mortis in a cozy pub. Every witness swears that the freak accident was caused by a dart that punctured the victim's finger. But to Inspector Roderick Alleyn, the "accident" is really a clever case of murder and everyone in the bar has a motive! Agatha Troy is enlisted by Thomas Ancred to paint a portrait of his father, an egotistical, ham of a Shakespearean actor in time for the old man's seventy-fifth birthday. The noted thespian lives in a lavish, gothic-style mansion and takes great delight in disobeying his doctor's orders by indulging in rich food and alcohol and offending his grown children by taking on a seemingly not-very-bright peroxide blonde of an actress fifty years his junior as his mistress. Besides Thomas' wife Milamant, who acts as his caregiver, Sir Henry has four middle-aged daughters and numerous grandchildren, all of whom form a most dysfunctional family, always bickering and jockeying for position in the old man's will, which he regularly rewrites depending on his latest whim. He becomes furious when Agatha's portrait of him as Macbeth, his most celebrated role, is vandalized, and he spitefully rewrites his will for what will be one last time. Percival Pyke-Period isn't all he seems to be. Although he's rich and displays good breeding, he's not of aristocratic birth but has taken the identity of a now-deceased noble family. His divorced neighbor, Harold Cartell, has taken residence in the manor house but has not endeared himself to anyone, including the servants. After Pyke-Period's antique cigarette case is stolen, Cartell suspects his ex-wife's niece and her lower class boyfriend and demands its return. Cartell is later found in a newly dug sewer ditch along with the cigarette case and the concrete sewage pipe that crushed his skull. Luckily for Alleyn and Fox, all the suspects attend one of Pike-Period's luncheons. As a sidebar, an art forger is passing his paintings as Agatha Troy's. In 1949 dying war hero and aristocrat Sir Henry Lacklander entrusts his friend Colonel Cartarette with publishing his memoirs posthumously. It is generally believed that it will at least in part refer in part to the suicide of the son of neighbor Octavius Phinn, who committed suicide in 1938 in a scandal that left him branded a Nazi-sympathizer. Further antagonism between Phinn and the Lacklanders results from Lacklander's accusation that Phinn's landing of a prize trout is result of poaching on his land. After Lacklander dies and Cartarette is found murdered, the investigative team of Alleyn and Fox find a significant chapter from the biography has gone missing, but none of those involved are forthcoming about what the enigmatic chapter contained. Sir Derek O'Callaghan is receiving death threats because of the position he takes as member of the House of Lords. He is taken to a nursing home with pains and dies during an operation - a death that is found to be murder. Alleyn investigates. Was it the nurse O'Callaghan used and rejected (and who was also in the operating room)? The doctor who loves her (and led the surgery)? Those threatening his life? Allis and Ann are best friends. But one day, when the girls are about twelve years old, Ann is killed in a road accident, and Allis becomes very cold inside and doesn't want any new friends. Her parents start working abroad and therefore, she has to live with her grandparents (who are the landlord and landlady of a big house) and begin going to a new school, where everybody teases her, because she is so odd and doesn't want to make friends with anyone. There is also another odd person who is teased in the class, Sigge, who is a Polish immigrant. When a bird gets hurt and Sigge takes care of it, Allis wants to help him somewhat. And after she let Sigge into the big house where she lives, nothing becomes the same and things start to happen, both in the house and in Allis's heart.

His family is quite another story! His wife Monica is looking for an encounter of the third kind... her kind! His son Benjamin is a cosmic super-hero fanatic and his daughter Betty, a manic depressive. Great topics for cocktail chat between Fax and Goodgrief, their cat and dog philosophers! "Sing-a-long at Skansen" (Stockholms Outdoor museum) Sweden's longest running seasonal radio & TV-show. It's been aired summer-Saturdays for more than 70 years (with a couple of breaks, 1952 - 1955 & 1967 - 1973). Starting on the radio in may 1935 with the singing teacher Sven Lilja (host: 1935 - 1951) at the microphone in front of a live audience. The songs were handed out at the entrance. At this time people sung folksongs, ballads and songs with patriotic spirit. He was followed by Egon Kjerrman (host: 1956 - 1966) who changed the repertoire towards temporary evergreens. After 10 years he left without a successor. His motto was: -'I sing rather than good' But in 1974, it was time again. This time with Bosse Larsson (host: 1974 - 1993) and still on the radio. TV aired the first TV-show in 1979 and since 1987 it's been aired live every Saturday. Bosse Larsson still comes on the show from time to time as a guest artist. The most popular host has to be Lasse Berghagen (host: 1994 - 2003) if you judge by size of audience. The record was set July, 8 2003 when he 'retired'. 36.256 persons showed up in front of the small stage at Skansen. He's a very popular singer/composer in Sweden and was the first 'real' artist to take up the microphone on Skansens stage. During his time the show also started taking in international artist, first out was Ricky Martin, July 10, 2001. Another sing-a-long guest was Wyclef Jean, who loved it so much, he never wanted to leave the stage and the 29.325 people in the audience. Anders Lundin (host: 2003 - ) started out as a sub/temp for Lasse Berghagen and was the natural choice at taking over the last shows of 2003. He's a known TV personality and soon gained access to the hearts of all swedes. So hopefully between 8-9pm summertime for many years to come, Stockholmers and the rest of Sweden, will fill the air with rather than good song.

John extended an offer of employment to Liza and she is happy to join the firm with a hire of her own, Wilson. Wilson recruits Nelle to join him in playing cold and dirty lawyer tricks with a sexual harassment case. Liza and John are defending a polygamist who isn't satisfied with only one husband.

It's Ally's thirtieth birthday, and Elaine wants to throw a party at the bar with everybody singing for her; bad singing voices and cat-fights ensue.

At home, Ally has to deal with Maddie's first sleepover and leans on Victor for support. John and Ally think they must be magnets for crazy cases when they are defending a nun who had sex. Stefan miraculously resurfaces but he's put on life support and John isn't privy to everything that happened to him. Renee runs into her Billy, her old high school flame, and while Ally gives good advice to her, she gives poor advice to Whipper and Richard. The whole firm is angry at Richard for accepting another ridiculous lawsuit that Ling has come up with, but as usual, Richard has no problem telling it as he sees it. Renee sets Ally up on a blind date from hell, and this time during the date, Ally gets herself stuck in another tight situation. John is continuously fraught over his relationship with Nelle, and things don't go well when he asks for advice or gets advice when he doesn't even ask for it. This show almost defies description.

Altair! When the King finds an ancient book, Grzzl wants to know what it's worth and Altair wants to discover what makes it so valuable. When they finally get the treasure to the Great Library... Grzzl gets a bitter disappointment, but Altair and the Kids have a wonderful surprise. Grzzl's mean attempts to charge the Kids at the entrance and exit of the Hall of Mirrors, results in Altair finding an alternative way out... into a labyrinth beneath the Fairground. There they meet a strange phantom character who, initially, terrifies them - but eventually proves, by saving them, that his intentions are good.

Gretchen has become a "Gypsy" Fortune-teller in Grzzlland. Altair agrees to write her "scripts". These turn out to be so successful that the Queen herself comes for a consultation.

Grzzl plans to make more money from Games of Chance on the very day when the Snorgelfant falls on Altair. Now Altair is the luckiest person in Starland. Grzzl's attempt to get this luck for himself - by having the Snorgelfant fall on him - fails. But he demonstrates that our luck is whatever we believe it to be. The King is pleased to discover that the Kids are interested in Golf. They have built their own Crazy Golf course. He takes this over and builds a Full-size, Adult Crazy Golf course.

Altair and the Kids find a natural source of Hot Chocolate - which Grzzl quickly exploits. But Gosho warns of the drink's strange side effects - excessive hilarity, weightlessness and finally, invisibility. He desperately seeks a remedy but time is running out. Then Mr.Horse proves that gravity and bad jokes are close allies. At the Annual Laundry Festival the Starish hang up their dirty clothes and beat out the stains. Altair discovers that this is happening beside a hot spring and a soap-tree.

Altair and the Kids have a simple rhythm band, which Vega likes. When the Clowns can't play for an important occasion at the Palace, Vega gets the "gig" for Altair's band. Their attempts to learn one tune on the Clowns' old instruments are complicated by many factors... but they end up with a very popular composition Gosho's tries to repair an old cylinder recorder... and so leaves his voice to be heard when he's gone. Altair misunderstands and thinks that Gosho has become invisible! Delighted at this idea, Grzzl also makes himself "invisible", and goes about mocking everyone... Altair, having found Gosho, returns to witness Grzzl's discomfort when he finds that "invisibility" is an illusion. Gosho, writing a review of Starland experience, takes Altair and pals to the Fair. Anxious to get a good report, Grzzl tries to hide the dangers. Gosho is skeptical about the 'sanitised' adventures youngsters now have (unlike the real adventures of his youth.) But he discovers that the risks of Grzzlland truly are character-building...and, as a result Grzzl an unreasonably good report. It's time for the Doctor to perform the Starish noodle-tuning procedure. Fearful of this, the King decides to be sent to Say-sorry Island. He asks Altair to help him commit an offence, but finding the right one is difficult. And, when he succeeds in being sent to the Island he discovers that the Doctor is coming too - to noodle-tune the prisoners! When Princess Vega breaks a vase in the Palace, Altair is blamed. Refusing to say "Sorry", he's sent to Say-Sorry Island, a miserable place of punishment, where the prisoners try to repent. But they're all saved when Vega finally admits that she's as sorry as can be! To allow Vega to attend the Grzzlland Jamboree as "an ordinary kid" Altair takes her place in the Palace for an afternoon. Little does he know that he's going to end up in a dress and veil taking part in a "secret ceremony" for the ladies of Starland. But, when he discovers that he must raise his veil and be kissed by all present... he decides it's time to bring Vega home. Altair has a pimple on his nose and Gosho's remedy only increases his embarrassment. Gretchen tries to help by putting an artificial "beauty mark" over the pimple. To encourage him she takes to wearing one herself... and soon an old fashion is revived. But, naturally, the King goes too far... destroying the fad... and Altair's "cover". There are Street Cleaners and Street Dirtiers in Starland. So, when Altair takes Gosho's treasures out of the wagon, they fall into the hands of these rival groups. Only when the King decides that all Starish rubbish is his, does Altair find a way to restore Gosho's private collection to him. Fully equipped with camping gear, Altair and other kids set off to Summer Camp. But he's shocked to find that Starish "camping" involve pitching tents on Clayton's living-room floor. Clayton is an enthusiastic (book-trained) teacher of camping skills. Weary of this regime, Altair leads the kids in a break-out to Jungle Island... And Clayton sets out to "bring them back alive"... The King thinks that his Coronation Anniversary has been forgotten. There's no sign of a Surprise Party, so he sulks and runs away from home. Altair goes with him and helps set up a "new Kingdom" on a nearby Island. Eventually they accept an invitation from the "neighbouring Kingdom" to a "Surprise Party". Determined to improve Grzzl's public image, Gretchen asks Altair to be his partner in the annual Maple Pie Harvest. Advised by Altair, Grzzl tries his best to be generous and kind. Finally, however, the effort becomes too much. He slyly attempts to steal the Pies. But this goes wrong - and, oddly, the failure improves Grzzl's reputation! Convinced that more should be done to investigate the archaeology of Starland, the Queen wants Gosho to be Minister of Culture. Gosho secretly encourages Grzzl to take this role...and, from this simple start, an elaborate election grows. Altair is Gosho's Election Manager. Grzzl, naturally, fights dirty. But his final victory does not bring the prestige he expected. When TNT comes to stay with Altair, his domineering Mother assures Gosho that he'll "be an Angel". But he's not. He launches a contagion of mischief that affects everyone. Even Altair is implicated. Things go so far that Gosho chooses "Straight-to-Bed-with-no-Supper" Island, rather than explain the outrages to TNT's Mother. The King is tricked into taking the first ride on Grzzl's new Ghost Train. His Majesty knows that his nervousness will make him a laughing-stock in public. So Altair sets about preparing the King for his ordeal - by scaring him with images from the Ghost Train, morning noon and night. By the time the King gets to take the ride, he's weary of the whole thing - and looks quite brave. Altair helps a complaining couple by moving builder's equipment away from their house. The result is a bridge built into the couple's bedroom, a door put in their back wall and citizens coming and going throughout the day. Things are finally sorted out, but Altair discovers that some people are only happy when they're moaning. A trivial dispute between the King and the Queen has escalated. The unity of Starland is threatened. Vega is very upset. Why, Altair wonders, won't Gosho intervene when he's idle, merely writing a play! But the play is produced, everyone is involved and its "message" reunites the Royal couple! During a golf game the King has an accident and drifts away. The Lifeguards are supposed to look after such emergencies... But they're too cowardly and too incompetent. So, Altair must rescue him - but how can he do it without revealing that he knows how to fly? Outraged Starish complain to the King about the lack of Justice and Grzzl's lack of honesty. The King seeks Grzzl's advice - on restoring confidence in the Law. He recommends a Trial... with Altair as the "Accused". The charge is Apple Treason. Can Gosho turn the Courts silliness and illogic against it to prove Altair's innocence? The Queen rejoices at the prospect of having important Royal visitors. And there'll be a young Prince to partner Vega. Determined to make her family (and the Starish community) worthy of this great occasion, she becomes insanely domineering. Altair is chosen as an "orphan" on whom she can bestow her charity. Naturally, everything goes horribly wrong... To deal with Clive's phobia about the Sky-shark, Altair organises the capture of the great beast. Grzzl immediately puts it on display in Grzzlland. Clive now adopts an absurdly "macho" stance - until a new accident occurs, and he loses his nerve again. Meanwhile Phoebe, unhappy at the Shark's plight, persuades Altair to help her in setting it free. Recently, Altair's advice has not been winning him any friends. But, when he takes a parasol and uses it as an umbrella the Starish think he really has lost his reason. The King, however, is intrigued. He builds a big umbrella and is blown up into the trees. Altair is blamed and his method of rescue is said to be reckless. The Queen wears a new star-patterned dress. To everyone's amazement Green Dog attacks her. While he's quarantined, and they try to figure out what kind of dog he is, frightening things happen to Starland's light. In the confusion of mid-day dusk Green Dog escapes...And Altair discovers that he is in fact the Great Star Dog. Gosho prepares a conjuring act for the Royal Command Performance. When Altair realises that the "Act" involves cutting him in half he begins to get nervous. And things get worse when Gosho (and all the adult Starish) are stricken with Hic-cups). On the night of the performance Altair has to think fast to save himself from the possibility of a gory end. All the kids in Starland have "Markies" - stripes on their skin - except Altair. And he feels so left out - especially when Gosho tells him that the kids got it from one another, by being so close. Altair tries to "fake" it - which is OK, until he realizes what the cure for "Markies" is. And then it's too late to back out. By pure accident Altair lands in a ridiculous position. He's amazed and amused to find that the Starish are very impressed. Assisted by the Kids he invents many silly scenes. The people hail him as a sage. This becomes such a burden that Altair must find a sensible invention to ruin his new reputation.

Many attempts have been made to produce an American version of the British hit comedy "Fawlty Towers", of which this show is one. Amanda, owner of the struggling hotel Amanda's by the Sea, is trying to keep her head above water despite her staff seemingly doing their best to drive her under. Included in the mix is Amanda's son, fresh out of hotel management school and full of more theory than experience, his wife, who would rather be back in the city, and the bellhop Aldo, whose home country is a mystery, but is definitely not somewhere that English is spoken. Across the city, the legend of a man sets women on fire. They say that his eyes can demolish the strongest woman; that his words are celestial music; that he is a master at exploring the feminine body. Some have even compared him to the mythical character Don Juan. He is Simon Luna, the most famous tourist guide in the Caribbean, specialized in taking vacationers to Venezuela's most exotic locations. Another detail makes this legend even more disturbing: the best lover in town has never been conquered by any woman. That is^ï¿½ until the arrival of Camila Rigores. A woman of incredible beauty and overpowering personality, she's the daughter of Leon Rigores, owner of the biggest hotel in the capital. Camila Rigores returns to Venezuela with the mission of managing her father's hotel and of reactivating the tourist industry across the country. But an unforeseeable tragedy occurs: Isabel Rigores, Camila's younger sister, commits suicide because of an unrequited love. Camila decides to get revenge for her sister's unexpected suicide and hunts down the man responsible for her death. That man is none other than Simon Luna. Camila Rigores works out a master plan. The great womanizer must be attracted with tasty bait, and what better bait than herself? Simon will be surprised by the sudden apparition of Camila Rigores in one of the most impressive locations of Venezuelan nature. She will make him her business partner, will challenge him to seduce her and will propose the rarest of bets. It is then that her duel to death with him begins. Simon, never suspecting that she is Isabel's sister, and totally ignorant of Isabel's death, is immediately captivated by Camila's beauty. He accepts the challenge of seducing her in a limited time period, and they each bet all of their assets, meaning complete ruin for the one who loses. The proposition is totally crazy, but it is a challenge that Simon simply cannot refuse. Starting the next day, Simon Luna will try to seduce the world's most difficult woman, while she sets her lethal trap. And this dangerous game will violently change their lives forever. But our story not only focuses on this memorable duel, as the El Dorado hotel harbors more love affairs than the city has ever known. The lives of both the hotel guests and employees will generate a kaleidoscope of tales: Powerful men, emancipated women, couples on the verge of separation, desperate singles, friends betraying friends, secret loves, blundering casanovas, heartless grandmothers and exuberant granddaughters.

Leonardo is also killed because he also knew the truth about Nora and Casilda's babies split at birth, and Casilda leaves Alejandrita with her real mother, Casilda's half-sister, Nora, and goes away with a trucker, and abandons Isaura in the dessert.

null Jan Delvo is the loyal director-playwright of an amateur theatre group. Just when he is about to present his latest piece of writing, chairman Jos Vanbeneden announces that celebrity Stanny Krets has shown interest to coach the next season.

Jan's wife exhausts his patience by offering his car to already lodged Stanny, whose broke down, and dragging the family to her 'graduation' as new-age something, a ridiculous tree-hugging affair.

Pierre is encouraged to move on his handicapped workshop 'beloved' Laura Sarapo, who just 'corrects' his vocabulary, incorrectly. The story is set in Central Visayas in the 1500s, during the time of Rajah Mangubat's reign. He was not only known as a good warrior, but also as an undefeated one. Nobody stood a chance against him especially with his extraordinary battle skills and his magical amulet. Not long after, a village priestess prophesizes that there will be a day that he will be defeated. Rajah Mangubat becomes anxious about the prophecy not only because he will eventually be defeated, but also because the person who will take over his power is a girl - a girl who has a snake for a twin. With this, he orders all pregnant women in his own village tribe and also in others to be killed. Datu Bugna's village is the only one that survives Rajah Mangubat's terror because they have long been friends and alliances. What Rajah Mangubat doesn't know is that the baby girl that he has been looking for to be killed has been born in Datu Bugna's village. Amaya is Datu Bugna's daughter from Dal'lang, a slave woman. And because he wants to protect Amaya, he hides her in a secret chamber as a "binukot" and tells her that Dal'lang, is already dead. Amaya's twin snake is thrown away to the forest and is told that it may only come back if Amaya is in dire need of help. Amaya has once attempted to escape from her chamber when she wanted to see the outside world for the first time. That was when she saw Prince Bagani for the first time. They immediately fell in love with each other. No matter the distance and the years that have passed, they still have not forgotten that day when they first met. Because of Lamitan's evil desire to get rid of Amaya, she betrays her husband Datu Bugna and tells Rajah Mangubat her husband's plan of revolt. Rajah Mangubat's men take Amaya from her chamber and use her as blackmail to make Datu Bugna confess. He eventually does and Rajah Mangubat kills him in front of Amaya.

The 5 pounds has to cover food, accommodation and travel; the 5 pounds reflecting the average hourly wage according to the Department of Trade and Industry in the U.K. Leon had certain cities he had to pass through and was only ever allowed to stay for 24 hours in each city. The 5 pounds could not roll over and had to be spent, with each morning being presented a new five pound note for each new day. The public could buy him things and he could work for goods, but was never allowed to be given money directly. The results were truly amazing, hence the name, with our "nobody" meeting some fascinating people such as Jack the lobster fisherman in locations as grand as Lord Glasgow's Scottish castle and as beautiful as the Welsh Coast. Leon ends his quest, venturing from a hostel in Venice Beach toward the Hollywood sign on the hostel manager's bicycle with broken brakes, along the way he visits a glass blowing shop and gets free breakfast on Rodeo Drive before struggling up the Hollywood Hills Following in the tradition of "America's Funniest Home Videos", this program lets viewers at home send in tapes of their pets or other animals performing strange tricks, getting into unusual situations, or, most frequently, just being themselves. The Sabbath meant so much to Jesus that He rested on the Sabbath day from His work of saving the human race. He didn't rise Sunday morning to inaugurate a new day. He rose to go back to work as our High Priest. This episode is a continuation. Does the Bible talk about health? Is it something important for us to consider? There is a clear connection between how we eat and how we live. The story of Daniel not defiling himself sets the stage for being responsible for our bodies. Our spiritual perceptions are fogged by drugs, alcohol, and poor living habits. In this episode, the story of Lazarus being raised from the dead comes to life.

River of the Future recounts Cousteau's final leg of his 1984 expedition. The second longest river in the world, the Amazon snakes through the entire northern half of the South American continent. Cousteau's team investigates the river system's exotic plant life and the intriguing creatures that live there. The team also visits a tropical forestry operation, a project which may foreshadow the end of this beautiful and significant region of the planet. A commercial aircraft crashes in the Amazon rain forest in Brazil, leaving only a handful of survivors. Their hopes of being rescued aren't very good, as the Amazon proves to be even more hostile than the terrifying plane crash which brought them there: they must cope with an extremely hostile environment: piranhas, deadly snakes, flesh-eating ants, poisonous plants, hostile tribes, and more. In his style as participating anthropological observer, fit and flexible British army-vet Bruce Parry travels along the vast Amazon, trough several South American states. He meets tribal people, 'ordinary' locals, people from (often foreign) exploiting firms, even drug traders, rebels and soldiers chasing those. Former Royal Marine Bruce Parry starts his journey along the Amazon at its Peruvian source in the Andes, the other domineering feature in South America. There live the Quechua, the ethnic Inca descendants, who still mix pagan and other traditions with the conquistadors' Spanish Catholic culture. Bruce's host family chew coca-leaves and herd alpacas, llamas producing the best wool. In the valley down-stream, past world-class daunting rapids, lives the Ashaninka tribe, who cultivate coca, which legal and has legitimate uses to chew against the altitude. Coca is also processed chemically, involving grave river pollution, into a paste which is the basis for cocaine, illegal but without realistic alternative in market terms, although their share of the drug trade profit is minute. Bruce joins a US-supported army raid on the cocaine production, which has no net effect. Their jungle is invaded by loggers and guerrillas. Bruce's brain-infected producer Matt's life depends on an urgent far helicopter flight to Lima. Bruce visits the Peruvian Achuar tribe, which lives in a pristine Amazon forest region. His host village is reluctant and mistrusting, which makes sense as neighboring communities, which accepted deals with oil companies, suffered wide-spreading pollution and cultural ruin. Bruce finds helping with logging and fishing particularly hard because of the daily purification with wayous, a beverage from a bitter vine, which induces violent vomiting. Much more is supposed to allow visions, but Bruce's rational ego resist. That occurs again in a city downstream, where it's mixed with hallucinogenic leaves such as dattura. He passes the Brazilian border and arrives in a town just before carnival, Rio style with a weird twist: everybody cross-dresses. Bruce visits by river Itui the Valle de Javari, a relatively pristine Brazilian nature and tribal reserve. It's home to various tribes, including the Matis, where Bruce spend a month for his Tribe series, so they welcome him as an old friend and implore help as even more terrible diseases such as STD hepatitis B spread, beyond shaman therapy. Next Bruce meets the Marubo, the reserve's largest tribe, made up a century ago by remnants of deep forest tries fleeing rubber slavery. He partakes in the macho excruciating trucadeiro ant bites ritual and ritual drum logging. Finally he joins a band of non-industrial loggers, who try to harvest hardwood selectively, claiming the track grows back even more diverse. The embassy welcomes the annoying minor royal and trade envoy Prince Mark of Bath, who has come to the country to help secure the licence for Anglo-Brit oil. He is extremely vain, taking an ironing board everywhere to keep his trousers crease-free and a difficult guest, demanding sexual threesomes. Meanwhile Neil is sheltering Amil Zarifi, an anti-government dissident who has escaped from jail and is hiding in the embassy with Jennifer's approval. Learning that the information Neil was blackmailed into giving them was false and aware of Zafifi's presence in the embassy, the secret police want him handed over to them and Keith wants to comply to save the oil contract. But Zarifi finds an unexpected ally when he bumps into Mark and they get drunk together, Zarifi horrifying Mark with stories of the Tazbekistan regime. This in turn leads to Mark delivering an amazing speech to the president which secures the oil deal as well as Zarifi's freedom. Keith Davis is the inept British ambassador in the Asian state of Tazbekistan, a country whose human rights record is as dire as its national dish, plov, which is all Neil's snooty wife Jennifer seems to get. Attempting to secure an order for British helicopters from the president Keith starts badly by shooting an ibex, the national animal of the country, though he manages to blame the French ambassador. Keith's capable deputy Neil Tilly and his assistant Caitlin are more concerned with securing the release of activist Simon Broughton from prison. Neil is approached by a national who blackmails him with incriminating photos into "helping us", though Simon is released. Keith organizes a British evening to impress the president, including arrogant actor Stephen Pembridge performing a one man show of Frankenstein, Morris dancers and a chutney-making demonstration. In the event the contract goes to the French, who have brought in a cabinet minister to stress the importance of the transaction. Hard-as-nails government vetting officer Robert Jackson arrives in Tazbekistan and walks the fifteen miles from the airport for the embassy staff appraisal. However, during a party to celebrate the president's platinum jubilee a revolt begins, led by Neil's girlfriend Natalia's brother. The P.O.D. in London tells the ambassadors that they must identify with the winning side for continued good relations but Keith fumbles his chance to withhold the president's pop star/football manager daughter Fergana's visa application to find out her father's true intentions. Then Jennifer, appalled at the regime's brutal response to the rebellion, forces Keith to make peace with the rebels - though they capture him and he is freed by the British army. The revolt fails and Neil blackmails Jackson into giving the embassy a glowing report, as well as giving Natalia safe passage to England.

The therapist puts through a series of tests for him to overcome his fear. And the final test is for him to be in the room with an actual snake but when the snake gets out he starts to panic.

Yul Kwon journeys across the continent by air, road and rail and ventures behind the scenes with the workers who get us where we need to go. America has produced a wide variety of folk music and dance, raging from the fishing songs of the east coast to the cowboy ballads of the old west, and this show presented viewers with a sampling of it. Hosted by musician and singer Paul Arnold and featuring a rotating cast of singers and dancers, this program included a new lineup of performances each week of its year-long run. Held during the Dewey-Truman election campaign of 1948 and hosted by well-known pollster George Gallup, this program kept American TV viewers updated on the state of the campaign by providing weekly opinion poll figures taken both nationally and inside the TV studion. In addition to simply showing the numbers, this program also introduced viewers to polling methods and explained the various factors that can affect the results. The program ended in October, which means the infamous "Dewey Defeats Truman!" announcement was not made on this show. Hosted by Robert Trout and running during the summer of 1951, this program invited guests from various fields to discuss issues of importance that were facing Amerca. Some of the topics dicussed by Trout and guests included international relations, including the growing threat of world communism, and various other issues of interest to viewers. This late-evening news program typically followed the late 11 o'clock local news on most stations. Hosted by news veteran Charles Kuralt, and with support from reportes Leslie Stahl and Edie Magnus, this show provided viewers with a recap of the day's news stories, from politics and scandals to international crises and natural disasters. Originally started as an evening news magazine for providing in-depth looks at the major stories from around the nation, this show found itself hijacked by what would become America's biggest news story of 1994: The OJ Simpson murder trial, and soon was featuring it a regular part of the weekly news lineup. Also included was a "sound off" segment in which a guest commentator would speak about some topic of their choice, after which viewers could call in from home to make their own opinions on the matter heard.

In AMERICA UNEARTHED, forensic geologist Scott Wolter, will try to reveal that the history we all learned in school may not always be the whole story. Across the country, ancient symbols, religious relics and unexplained artifacts suggests that civilizations from around the world have left their mark for us to find today. Wolter not only digs through the surprising burial ground that is America for archaeological secrets, but he also uncovers compelling theories that allegedly predates the official "discovery" of the New World and tries to turn a lot of what we know about American history on its head. America Unearthed goes out to prove that there is a lot we don't know about our past, and that people allegedly have gone to great lengths to cover up these mysteries. A man shows up at Scott Wolter's lab with a 500-pound discovery. In the flatbed of his truck is a large boulder he pulled from the Arkansas River, inscribed with a mysterious bull symbol. Wolter's investigation into who carved the stone and for what ritualistic purpose ultimately reveals a connection between the ancient Egyptian cult of the Apis bull, the mysterious religion known as Mithraism and a party of pre-Columbian explorers to Oklahoma's panhandle. In the end, carvings in a cave in America's Heartland shed light on an ancient connection that could prove a group of religious outcasts made it to America in pre-Columbian times. There are 800 very old, very mysterious, man-made stone sites in the Northeastern part of the United States. Forensic geologist Scott Wolter heads to rural Pennsylvania to investigate one of them - a meticulously crafted stone chamber buried underground in the woods. When he realizes it may have been a ritual bath chamber for a secret society, he embarks on a quest for answers as to who built it, when and why. The Holy Grail is one of the most sought after treasures of all time, and one treasure hunter thinks he knows exactly where it is. He invites Scott Wolter along on his quest to find it, and the result is a North American treasure hunt of epic proportions. When Scott Wolter gets a call from his friend John DeSalvo, an avid collector of Abraham Lincoln memorabilia, he has no idea that he's about to embark on a quest to learn whether there were a lot more people than just John Wilkes Booth behind the assassination of one of America's most influential presidents. Evidence Wolter uncovers suggests Booth was part of an infamous group of Confederates who formed a secret society called the Knights of the Golden Circle; a group that included influential politicians and rogue raiders like Jesse James. The evidence Scott complies suggests a new twist on the motives behind Lincoln's killing, and takes him on a wild ride through the history of the South at the time of the Civil War as seen through the eyes of the Knights of the Golden Circle. After his famous expedition to map the American West with William Clark, Meriwether Lewis recorded details of the adventure in a journal and intended to publish it. Before he could, he was shot and killed in an inn on the Natchez Trace. His death has been classified as a suicide, but as forensic geologist Scott Wolter discovers, there's reason to think he may not have killed himself. As Wolter investigates the death of America's most famous explorer he uncovers details that suggest President Jefferson himself may have had ulterior motives for the Lewis and Clark expedition that have never made it into the history books and may have led to his violent death. In the late 1500s, years before Jamestown, the English sought to create their first settlement in America at Roanoke. A party of 119 colonists came over and settled but ultimately vanished. The fate of the Lost Colony of Roanoke has eluded archaeologists, historians and North Carolina locals, but as forensic geologist Scott Wolter discovers, a series of 48 stone clues that have been largely ignored and considered frauds may in fact hold the answer to America's oldest cold case. What might Washington D.C. have in common with ancient sites like Stonehenge? It is thought by some to be constructed using an ancient unit of measurement called the megalithic yard. Thought to be used by some of the greatest civilizations of all time, this antiquated unite of measure could be the key to understanding the hidden meaning behind D.C.'s streets and structures. Scott Wolter investigates whether its use in the design plans of our nation's capitol created a sanctuary for people practicing goddess worship; people, like George Washington himself. Geologist Scott Wolter has reason to believe America has its very own Stonehenge in New Hampshire. With the help of a young man who discovered an amazing connection between America's Stonehenge and Stonehenge in England, Wolter explores the possibility that the ancient Phoenicians are connected to both of these megalithic sites. At America's Stonehenge, he uncovers many clues, including a sacrificial table and a mysterious message carved on a stone in ancient script that helps advance this provocative theory. He also discovers both sites are accurate astronomical calendars and that alignments with the heavens are incorporated into their design. In Florida, Scott Wolter is called in to investigate a mystery surrounding a group of early inhabitants of the Sunshine State known as the Windover Bog People. As Scott learns about the perfectly preserved specimens, he discovers they have some unique features that could suggest they are European. And if they were, it would mean European travelers made it to America some 7,000 years ago. It's a shocking revelation--but not as shocking as what Scott learns next--that group of Europeans known as the Solutreans may have been here thousands of years before that, and actually predated Clovis people, who have long been thought to have crossed the Bering Strait land bridge and been America's very first settlers. The key to solving the mystery of just how long ago Europeans were here could be a single artifact--a small stone carving of a mammoth discovered by a man near Vero Beach, Florida that dating suggests is 13,000 years old. Heading to Tucson, Arizona with his son Grant, Wolter is eager to investigate a mysterious cache of crosses, swords and other relics pulled from the desert in the 1920s. One sword has a date--800 AD--written in Latin, which would suggest a group of Europeans was in the American Southwest hundreds of years before Columbus made it to America. Wolter's investigation is particularly important for one man--the grandson of the man who helped discover the items. The investigation could determine whether the artifacts are part of an elaborate hoax or part of a find that could change history. Scott Wolter gets a call from a man who has a mysterious stone on his property. He's convinced that it's the "Stone of Destiny"-the stone that Jacob from the Bible rested his head on when he dreamed of a stairway to Heaven. As Scott investigates, he discovers the stone was once kept with something even more valuable. It was once kept with the Ark of the Covenant and both are rumored to have been brought to America. Scott's quest for the truth leads him to a sacred site in Ireland called the Hill of Tara and to a mysterious site in Arizona where a petroglyph depicting what could be the Ark could suggest its final resting place is right here in the United States. And, as for who brought it here, a tablet inscribed with the Ten Commandments found with a series of other artifacts could suggest a likely group of candidates-the Lost Tribes of Israel. In 1200 AD at the same time the Vikings were discovering North America along the East Coast, new evidence suggests another group of intrepid voyagers may have been discovering the New World on the opposite end of the globe. When an obsidian spear point of mysterious origins is discovered by a group of hikers on the island of Maui, Scott Wolter is called in to investigate. Delving into it's origins, he discovers the artifact may have come all the way from Mexico--and is just one more clue in a mounting pile of evidence suggesting Polynesian voyagers made it there and back. What Scott wants to know is if they made it to Central and South America, could they have made it all the way to North America? Scott Wolter receives a tip that there are pyramids at the bottom of a lake in Lake Mills, Wisconsin. As he investigates, he learns local legend suggests they were built by Aztecs and over time, they've been buried as land and water have shifted. When Scott Wolter began investigating mysterious artifacts, he started to notice one unique symbol appeared on many of them. The symbol, now known as the "Hooked X", baffled researchers who couldn't make sense of it. As Scott's investigation into the origins of the symbol unfolds, he realizes its use is unique to just two notoriously secret groups--the Knights Templar and their modern day brethren, the Freemasons. Used in secret codes, cryptic ciphers and even the alleged tomb of Jesus himself, the symbol could be the key to understanding two of the biggest mysteries of all time--exactly what the Holy Grail is, and where it's hidden today. In 1000 AD, the Vikings made it to North America, establishing a base camp in Newfoundland at a site called L'Anse aux Meadows. But could they have made it further South to what is now the United States to build a permanent settlement called Vinland. Following 9/11, the U.S. government adopted some controversial new tactics intended to prevent future terrorist attacks, including warrantless eavesdropping on Americans' phone calls, secret demands for records under the Patriot Act, and FBI sting operations against people thought to be potential terrorists. The Bush Administration contends these tactics have helped to save American lives, but critics say they have severely damaged our individual liberties. SECURITY VERSUS LIBERTY: THE OTHER WAR explores this urgent national debate by talking with leading critics and advocates of the new policies, and telling the stories of people whose lives have been directly affected. This program provides valuable information that will help Americans come to grips with the difficult choices we face. This documentary series looks at the evolution of specific character types appearing on American primetime episodic television from post WWII to the early twenty-first century. These characters were often a reflection of the times and often shaped by world events such as WWII, the Vietnam War and 9/11, but some also influenced behavior and attitudes, especially of such characterizations in future television shows. Landmark characterizations are presented and the reasons for them being landmarks are discussed. In the early days of television, American prime time provided an idealized and stereotypical view of the American woman, who was more often than not portrayed as being subservient to the man, basically as housewife and mother in service to the family. In real life, most American women could could not measure up to this idealized view. From 1950 to 1970, three lead characters are seen as groundbreaking away from this stereotype (despite two being wife and mother): Lucy Ricardo in _"I Love Lucy" (1951)_ (qv), Laura Petrie in _"The Dick Van Dyke Show" (1961)_ (qv) and Mary Richards in _"Mary Tyler Moore" (1970)_ (qv), who were each independent for different reasons, much of those reasons specific to the era. Other characterizations of independent women that followed owed much to these three, and were reflective of the times. They include Roseanne Connor in _"Roseanne" (1988)_ (qv), and the title character in _"Murphy Brown" (1988)_ (qv). The lack of advertising on cable opened up the role of the independent woman even more, with _"Sex and the City" (1998)_ (qv) being one of the earliest successes. Current examples of American prime time shows that feature independent women include _"Desperate Housewives" (2004)_ (qv), _"Weeds" (2005)_ (qv), _"Grey's Anatomy" (2005)_ (qv), _"Nurse Jackie" (2009)_ (qv) and _"The Good Wife" (2009)_ (qv). Similarities between the women portrayed in these shows are that they are far from perfect but they are true to most parts of their selves. In the post WWII days of American primetime television, the depictions of men at home as being the stable breadwinner who could solve any problem that faced the family was borne out of a need for the American populace to feel safe. The counterculture movement of the 1960's made those depictions seem outmoded and unrealistic. The shows of 'Norman Lear' (qv), most specifically _"All in the Family" (1968)_, broke open that mold, where the men were shown as being independent thinkers often regardless of the needs of the family. By the mid 1980's, these two trends melded with _"The Cosby Show" (1984)_ (qv), where Cliff Huxtable had a very specific point of view with regard to how to raise his often defiant children. In the 1990's and beyond, the post-feminist era made the man at home more undefined, where he could be placed in almost any role, from the self-absorbed shlub (such as Ray Barone or Homer Simpson) to the self-doubting family man (such as Michael Steadman, Tony Soprano or Walter White). And different forms of the family and their associated issues are also now shown, from _"Modern Family" (2009)_ (qv) to _"Big Love" (2006)_ (qv) to _"The Bernie Mac Show" (2001)_ (qv). The character of the crusader, who always took some sort of risk to achieve the desired triumphant end, was very much the typical "white" hero in the very "black and white" characterizations of the 1950s and early 1960s. That sort of hero was most evident in the many westerns of the era. This characterization was borne out of the winning attitude of WWII, where many Americans wanted to believe their heroes - predominantly males - did no wrong. Men wanted to be like them, and women loved them. The Vietnam era ushered in a new compassionate view, reflective of a character like Hawkeye Pierce in _"M*A*S*H" (1972)_ (qv). The character of Andy Sipowicz in _"NYPD Blue" (1993)_ (qv) was one of the first characterizations where the crusader was by no means perfect, but lived by his own moral code. More recent such characterizations, which often portray the crusader choosing the greater good - in the eyes of his own moral code - over personal happiness, and/or legal or political correctness, include Frank Pembleton in _"Homicide: Life on the Street" (1993)_ (qv), Vic Mackey in _"The Shield" (2002)_ (qv), Omar Little in _"The Wire" (2002)_ (qv), Gregory House in _"House M.D." (2004)_ (qv) and Dexter Morgan in _"Dexter" (2006)_ (qv). Perhaps the character with who most people within recent memory have rooted for, despite his internal struggles and flaws, is Jack Bauer in _"24" (2001)_ (qv). In the few instances where the crusader has been a woman, she is often portrayed side by side, or even slightly subservient to the male crusader, such as Dana Scully to Fox Mulder in _"The X Files" (1993)_ (qv). The character of the misfit has long been a staple in American primetime television, especially in comedies, whose inherent nature is to pick on the odd. The audience often roots for the misfit when he doesn't crumble under the scrutiny of what are considered normal social circumstances. Shows like _"The Beverly Hillbillies" (1962)_ (qv) and _"The Addams Family" (1964)_ (qv) showed a group of misfits trying to assimilate into the world around them but not really knowing how. _"Taxi" (1978)_ (qv) had the extra dimensions of having the group trying to cope in their world while adding the mean character - in this case, Louie de Palma - into the mix. _"Seinfeld" (1990)_ turned the concept around by having the misfits existing on their own terms. _"Twin Peaks" (1990)_ (qv) created a surreal world in which the already misfit group moved. _"Freaks and Geeks" (1999)_ (qv) showed the angst faced by misfits in high school. And _"The Larry Sanders Show" (1992)_ (qv) showed how celebrity misfits try to achieve that love that many misfits desire. More recent trends with misfits on American primetime television are the sense of narcissism that many misfits have, and that misfits are becoming the new "normal".

Written by Jean-Marc Rocher {rocher@fiberbit.net} "America's Funniest Home Videos" was inspired by a series of successful TV specials, where home viewers were invited to send in videotapes of their "funniest" moments. In "AFHV," host Saget provided commentary to the home videos which often showed wedding and sports bloopers, children and pets either being themselves or getting into trouble, furniture or other objects giving way (usually contributing to someone's fall) and "comical" reactions to getting inadvertently hit (usually in the groin). Sometimes, certain videos were grouped into themes, such as Christmas or a summer vacation, or had sentimental value to them, such as a marriage proposal; other times, videos were set to classic rock tunes. The top three videos of the week as selected by the producers were eligible for each week's $10,000 top prize; the audience would electronically vote for their one favorite video. Weekly winners got to compete in a later special for a $100,000 top prize. Segments include: Cranky dogs, funny blondes, dancing animals, practical joke backfires, "Great Moments in Bad Ideas", "Kids who Smear Stuff All Over Themselves", 29 people falling off 29 horses in 29 seconds. Carrie Ann Inaba makes a guest appearance to play "Who's Makin' that Racket?" and receive a pratfall award for her Dancing with the Stars mishap. As America's Funniest Home Videos gained in popularity, the producers found that many people were starting to stage their own situations, rather than depending on random chance to grant them a winning shot. This program was created to give these amateur film producers a chance to show off their creativity and perhaps win the $100,000 grand prize.

Contestants vie for the opportunity to see their original restaurant concept be realized with the opening of a restaurant chain in three locations: Hollywood, Minneapolis and New York City. Funding the restaurant concepts are four accredited investors: chefs Bobby Flay, Lorena Garcia, and Curtis Stone, as well as Steve Ells, founder, chairman and co-CEO of Chipotle. Flay, Stone, Ells and Garcia also serve as mentors, working with the competitors to further develop their ideas. Each contestant's concept is put through rigorous business and cooking challenges to determine whether it has what it takes to become America's next great restaurant. The top ten hopeful restaurateurs are tasked with their next test -- to create a logo and hire an executive chef for their restaurant. Following these two tests, the contestants and their new chefs must then cook for a crowd of thousands at CityWalk at Universal Studios Hollywood. They must impress investors Bobby Flay, Curtis Stone, Steve Ells and Lorena Garcia with the decisions they made in order to stay in the competition. The remaining nine restaurateurs are tasked with their next test -- to work a crazed lunch shift at Chipotle and learn the brand. Investors Bobby Flay, Curtis Stone, Steve Ells and Lorena Garcia and the public will rate the restaurateurs performance. After experiencing how to run a successful restaurant, they must create their own slogan and signature dish for their restaurant and impress 100 people from "The Taste of LA."

The restaurateurs' pods and meals will come to life at the annual "Dine LA" event in Los Angeles where they must impress designers and foodies who will vote for their favorites.

The restaurateurs' photos, uniforms and a new dish will then be showcased to 100 diners. The six remaining restaurateurs are tasked with their next test - to create their very own food truck, with the help of a graphic designer, and sell their food at busy Los Angeles hot spots. In addition to designing the food truck they must also have well priced "take-away" menu items that will yield the highest profit. Twenty-one hopeful restaurateurs face investors Bobby Flay, Curtis Stone, Steve Ells and Lorena Garcia for their chance at achieving the American dream of launching their own restaurant chain on the premiere of this new NBC competitive series. For their first test, the investors ask the potential restaurateurs to pitch their restaurant concept and serve an "iconic" item from their menu. After the investors have heard the pitches and tried the menu items, they will choose 10 concepts to move on in the competition. The final seven head to the studio to receive their next challenge. For the first time, the contestants will all work together. Their challenge is to produce two segments for a new children's show. One of the two segments must be a musical. The contestants have to pick a team leader. They all decided that Daniel will be their leader, so he divides the team in half. Zo, Schliz, and Gwen will work on the musical segment. Jessica, Evie, and Adam will work on the scripted segment. The next day, the remaining seven headed off to elimination. The musical segment was about making friends. The judges thought that they executed it. They liked the scene and how it led up to the song. They also liked the turtle's name Shellby and the lyrics to the song. The other segment was about protecting the environment and recycling. Daniel was asked if he got hired, and had a budget, to take six people but who would he not take. Daniel picked Gwen since she did not help him on the pitch. Schliz was asked the same question, and he picked Gwen as well. Gwen had to pick a person as well, and she chose Daniel. Zo picked Evie since he has had problems with her. Jessica picked Daniel. Unexpectedly, Evie picked Zo to go home. Adam refused to answer the question, but when he was forced to pick someone, he chose everyone to go instead of him to go home (that was his way to avoid the question). The contestants were then excused from the room, while the judges picked which one should go home. The seven remaining contestants were brought back into the room. Jessica was the winner, since it was her idea for the scripted segment and for the name she gave the turtle. Zo was saved for writing the song. Evie and Schliz were also saved. Daniel was saved, which left Gwen or Adam to be eliminated. Adam was eliminate since he could not deliver a answer right away.

In this episode we look at how entertainment from circuses and vaudeville to plays and movies, influenced the common words and phrases we say every day. How did bad actors give us the word "explode," rude actors give us the phrase "to upstage" someone, and superstitious actors give us "break a leg?" How did the circus give us words like "jumbo" and "Siamese twins," and the idea that politicians "jump on the bandwagon?" Why did vaudeville invent "deadpan" humor, "slapstick" comedy and "off color jokes?" And how did the movies give us expression like "cut to the chase" and "cliffhanger? In this episode, we look at the ways that American English has been transformed by the Vikings, the Cold War, computers, music, gambling, and the different meaning we give to the colors of the rainbow. Why is a "red letter day" good, but being "in the red" is bad? Why do we "boot up" a computer? What's a "jackpot" and why do we "hit" it? Did the term "Cold War" really begin in the Middle Ages? And what's the original meaning of the Viking word "thing"? All these terms show the ways that American English has been invigorated by crises from Viking invasions to the threat of nuclear war, and inspired by the colors we see, the music hear...and the money we lose in bets. And they prove that when it comes to our unique American language, we speak our history every day. If you just know where to look. In this episode, we look at the ways that American English has been transformed by American presidents, by the language of sex and romance, by good and bad manners. We'll also explore how easy it is to insult people of different groups without even realizing it. Did you know who invented the phrase Founding Fathers, and what the Founding Fathers originally called themselves? Or how American presidents popularized terms like "three martini lunch," "lunatic fringe" and "keep the ball rolling?" When it comes to insults, did you know that the cheer "hip hip hurray" was originally anti-Semitic, "hooligan" was anti-Irish, and the phrase "in cahoots" was anti-French? When it comes to sex, how did a diet of meat give us the word "mating," why do young men "sow their wild oats," and why is the word "hysterical" an insult to women? And when it comes to manners, we'll explore the strange roots of words like "posh," "snob," "stuck up" and even "hello" and "goodbye. In this episode, we look at the ways that American English was transformed by the high seas, the ancient world, the movers and shakers of big business, and the news industry. Ever wonder why we're "pooped" when we're tired? Or say that a drunk is "three sheets to the wind"? Why do we say our "ears are burning" if someone's talking about us, and why is October the 10th month, even though its name means "8th"? Why is a rich, powerful person called a "tycoon"? And why are those supermarket scandal sheets called "tabloids"? All these terms show the powerful impact that sailing, big business, the ancient world and the news media have had on American English. In this episode, we look at the ways that American English has been transformed by the clothes we wear, the crimes we commit and the punishments we receive, the insults we use...and the internet. Ever wonder why, when we "speak off the cuff," we're "flying by the seat of our pants"? Why is a street robbery called a "mugging," and does "blackmail" really have anything to do with mail? What's the difference between a "nerd" and a "geek," and who was the first person to use "OMG"? All these terms show the ways that American English has built up a wardrobe of words by begging, borrowing and stealing. Every day we use words and phrases that come from deep within our history. Their origins reveal a lot about us and where we came from, but most of us have no idea what these terms originally meant. In this episode we look at how forms of transportation from horses to trains to cars, and different intoxicating substances from opium to booze, influenced the common words and phrases we say every day. Why do insensitive people "ride roughshod" over others, while lucky people ride the "gravy train?" Who put the jay in "jaywalker," and the bus in "busboy?" Why are "highways" high, what do "turnpikes" turn, and why is a wild person "hell on wheels?" When it comes to substances, who put the hero in heroin, the junk in junkie, and the ooze in booze? And what's the connection between George Washington and the words grog and groggy? In this episode, we look at the ways that American English has been transformed by animals, food, sports--and death. Ever wonder why we say "that's a horse of a different color" or "that's for the birds"? Why do we "chew the fat" when we talk or "put up our dukes" when we fight? And why, when we die, do we "kick the bucket"?

The format was fairly simple: prominent persons, including politicians, writers, scientists and other experts, would come and debate various issues of the day. Subjects frequently were controversial, challenging popular opinion on subjects like the supposed spread of Communism, or the country's involvement in overseas wars. It's about the northwest archipelago, from Midway through to west-northwest of Kauai. Much of the area was set aside for federal protection in the early 2000s. The video follows a team of diving scientists as they inspect some of the aqueous fauna. We're told they identify several isolated populations of fish, molluscs, and other animals within this large area. Unlike the vastly-superior David Attenborough shows, this National Geographic one focuses primarily on the activities of the crew--rather than the subject matter itself. Much time is spent showing us *that* research is being done, leaving little time for the few discoveries mentioned. The video does not attempt an overview of the area; shots of corals and fish are incidental to following the team around. Shows large amounts of beached trash, floated from California. Shows monk seals and large turtles, dependent on these low atolls--which will soon be under water as Greenland ice melts.

It's the beginning of the daredevil stunt season and Mr. Dizzy, Dr. Danger, and Spanky and Bryan Spangler are all champing at the bit to get their first stunts of the year under their belts. For Spanky an epic wreck during his car jump (and the subsequent doctor's order to give it a rest) calls not only Spanky's plans for his second stunt--a highfall from Butte's highest building--into question, but also causes him to question his livelihood as a daredevil. Concerned for his father's safety, Bryan encourages Spanky to allow him to perform the highfall in his place. Down in Texarkana Texas, Dr. Danger kicks off his season with a fire run, and then motors out to his next performance; a domino car crash in Killeen. Up in Twin Falls Idaho, Mr. Dizzy is trekking to the cursed Magic Valley speedway. The last four daredevils to perform here have met with concussions, busted bones, and near death crashes; including Dizzy who suffered a concussion here last year. The Spanglers have arrived at Charlotte Motor Speedway, for the biggest stunt of their season thus far. With their "fly-by" car jump and dark clouds threatening rain looming, the pressure takes its toll on the father/son duo. Taking a breather between stunts, Dr. Danger visits the California desert where a dirt bike shaman named Bird plans to break the long distance motorcycle jump record, with a flight beyond 500 feet. However, as Dr. Danger knows all too well, the desert is a difficult place to stake your claim. Up in Monroe, Washington, Mr. Dizzy is getting his duck in a row for the biggest break of his daredevil career. He's been invited to the dirt track at CMS, and he's got a mind-blowing trick up his sleeve, but first he must test the prototype, a 360-degree spiral into a car stack, at his home track, in order to lock in his game plan. After spending the last few weeks recovering from his wreck in Abilene, Danger's in Maquoketa, IA and he's getting back in the saddle with the single biggest stunt of his entire career. Down south, the Spanglers are back in the lone star state, and Bryan Spangler's makin' one last stand, with an earth shattering pipe roll, to prove to the fans, and to Spanky, that he's strong enough to stand on his own two feet. Dr. Danger has made a promise to himself to climb out of obscurity. Now, the tiny desert town of Kingman Arizona is the spot where Danger is determined to prove himself worthy of the daredevil moniker by flying a full-sized school bus through the air, and into two other school buses stood on their ends; but as Dr. Danger soon finds out, sometimes the setup is even more dangerous than the stunt itself. Up in Monroe Washington, a last minute cancellation at the local track turns into an opportunity for Mr. Dizzy to bring something original to his home town fans. The goal: take a full sized Suburban SUV, attach a trailer with a boat on it, and launch off a ramp and over three RVs. Over in Mt. Pleasant Michigan, Spanky's young son Bryan headlines the show while his dad recoups from last week's crash. Crusher is sent to Vancouver by Mr. Dizzy to headline two stunts. After the promoter offers up a car, Crusher decides to throw in a third stunt, but he may have bitten off more than he can chew. In Texas, Dr. Danger's looking to get his mojo back after a tough go-round in Charlotte. He's got two stunts on tap; first a "gorilla stunt" in his home town of Austin, and then a classic four car stack in Abilene. He may be goin' back to his roots, but the good doctor gets way more than he bargained for. Since his horrific crash in Charlotte, Spanky Spangler has been sidelined and Bryan Spangler has been thrust into the spotlight. So tonight, Bryan's headlining at the world famous Texas Motor Speedway, but will he fill his father's shoes, or fall short of expectations? Meanwhile, in Monroe, Washington Mr. Dizzy's success in Charlotte has him moving full steam ahead. Word spread like wildfire about his epic limo spiral and bookings are pouring in, so he's giving Crusher a shot to represent the Mr. Dizzy brand as a solo act in British Columbia. Hot on the heels of a major blow up with his headliner, Crusher, Mr. Dizzy turns his attention to patching things up and executing his 8-stunt spectacular, Crash Factory Live. Jumps, crashes, and smashes abound, but when it all comes down to Crusher's T-Bone jump, will he take it too far just to prove that he's worthy of the headlining status? Dr. Danger is in Woodward, OK, where he intends to take on the much feared Megasaurus. A giant on the monster truck circuit that breathes fire and eats cars, Danger aims to jump his car through the mechanical dinosaur's flames and come out the other side without killing himself. But first Dr. Danger needs to keep his crew from killing one another. Meanwhile, Spanky and Bryan Spangler are in Phoenix, AZ preparing for their biggest stunt so far this season. For Mr. Dizzy, Dr. Danger, and the Spanglers it's the last show of the season, and they're all going out with a bang. At Texas Motor Speedway, Bryan Spangler's angling to step out from Spanky's shadow with a pipe roll of epic proportions. At his home track in Monroe, WA, Mr. Dizzy's giving his loyal fans a sneak peak of what's to come as he takes his stunt game to the next level. Dr. Danger's puts his life on the line to fulfill a promise that he made to himself at the beginning of stunt season. After a near fatal crash in Abilene, Dr. Danger is questioning if he's got what it takes to return to the circuit. Meanwhile, a new daredevil on the scene sets up for a show in Fulton, NY with a legendary stunt performer as his coordinator. Later, up in Washington, Crusher has to face Mr. Dizzy and answer for over extending himself during a recent show in Canada. With a successful car spiral under his belt, Mr. Dizzy puts the next phase of his epic scheme for CMS into play. To turn heads, Dizzy's going out on a limb financially and investing his entire bankroll in a limousine that he plans to spiral a full 360-degrees. If he succeeds, he'll have a new World Record under his belt. Meanwhile, down in Charlotte, it's go time for Bryan and Spanky Spangler. With their family feud and mechanical woes behind them, Sr. and Jr. stare down one last obstacle that threatens the show, and their safety...rain. After a promoter witnessed his incredible Bus Jump in Kingman, Dr. Danger's been invited to perform at the dirt track in Pahrump. With a limited window to prepare, Doc's bringing a unique twist to his Fire Wall stunt that the citizens of Pahrump won't soon forget. Spanky Spangler is booked at the hockey arena in Prescott, AZ, where he's going to perform his world famous Flaming High Fall. Spanky soon finds that there are several obstacles that stand between him and a successful fall; and when his son Bryan is nowhere to be found, that's one more problem that Spanky doesn't need. Mr. Dizzy steps out from behind the wheel to produce an 8-stunt spectacular that he likes to call Crash Factory Live. He's enlisted the top young daredevil talent from around the country to perform at his show, as well as his prot g s Crusher and Headache. Tonight, Mr. Dizzy and Dr. Danger are both booked to perform in front of thousands of fans at Charlotte Motor Speedway's dirt track. This is the first time that Danger and Dizzy have shared a bill, and they've been fighting like cats and dogs since they got here. It's a giant track, but it ain't big enough for the two of 'em. As showtime approaches, the tension between Dizzy and Danger grows, and the question is, can they get out of each other's way long enough to hit their marks. For Dizzy, it's all about collecting another world record, and for Danger, 22 years of struggle all comes down to this. After being sidelined by an injury for a week, Dr. Danger is back where he belongs--on the road. He and his crew are headed back to Pahrump Valley Speedway, where Danger's angling to make up for his weak showing the last time he performed here, with a stunt he likes to call Fireboxing. Meanwhile, up in Washington tension is building between Mr. Dizzy and Crusher. Dizzy hasn't been happy with Crusher's last few performances and the young prot g is hoping to get back on track with a hard hitting car stack collision.

In the process of doing so, Jake finds out about his friends and foes, Trixie find out something about herself, and Rose discovers something new about her past, that may further diminish her loyalty to the Huntsclan. In gratitude for rescuing them from some trolls, two leprechauns offer Jake a part-time job as security duty at a pawn shop they own, and the greed goes to his head as well as the heads of his friends... that is until the shop makes a deal with the huntsclan that could doom the entire magical wold.

The trouble is, the shock of this revelation ends up breaking his parents up before he was even born, and now he has no other choice but to find a way to get them back together again.

But in doing so, she is recorded talking with him, revealing that she has betrayed the Huntsclan. The Huntmaster blackmails Rose into helping him get the three skulls that Jake and Grandpa possess, by threatening her long lost parents, that he kidnapped her from after she was born.

The Huntsmaster begins to wish all magical creatures' destruction, but Rose shoots him, and instead wished the destruction of the Huntsclan. All the Huntsmen rise and disappear, wiped from existence. But since Rose is a member, she too begins to rise away. Jake grabs the last skull, and wishes that Rose had never been kidnapped. She vanishes, he smashes the skull, transforms, and flies away.

Jake's current mission is to track down a kelpie, a shape-shifting creature from the ocean that robs magical creatures of their power. After Ms. Derceto comes by to talk to his Grampa, the two of them start dating. Jake notices that kelpie attacks seem to happen whenever Ms. Derceto comes by, and he suspects that she is the kelpie. When he confronts her at her home, she jumps out of her wheelchair and attacks Jake. Jake captures her, but then realizes that she's a mermaid, one of several undercover merpolice that have been looking for the kelpie for a year. She thought Jake was the kelpie, due to the changes in his grades and attitude in the last year. They then realize that Grampa is defenseless against the kelpie, who is disguised as Fu Dog's date. They return to Grampa's shop and battle the kelpie, finally defeating him and turning him over to the merpolice. Sadly, though, Ms. Derceto must return to the ocean and break up with Grampa. Even worse, Jake's mythology teacher, Mr. Rottwood, has been promoted to principal. Spud breaks the HuntsClan encryption code and two trainees are captured. Jake and Spud replace them and go to the training facility to try to uncover another evil plot. What if Jake is caught? And who are the girls in Kara's vision who are fighting over Spud? Jake and Fu Dog are training at Gramps's store while Gramps takes Haley out trick-or-treating. Jake accidentally trips and falls outside of the store. But it being Halloween, nobody realizes that he's a real dragon. That gives Jake the idea of throwing a party with magical and non-magical guests, where the former can come out of hiding and just have a fun night. As the party gets going, three members of the Dragon Council arrive for a surprise inspection. They are disappointed in Jake's behavior, and strip him of his powers and demote both him and Gramps out of the Order. Jake takes the news bad and goes out for a walk. He then sees the Huntsclan capture the three councilors and fly them away. He hitches a ride with two fairies, who take him to a graveyard where the Huntsclan is going to witness Huntsgirl slay her first dragon. Needing more help, Jake goes back to the party. Everyone comes with him to the graveyard, where they distract Huntsgirl from slaying Councilor Chang, then proceed to rout the Huntsclan. The Huntsclan flees, and the councilors decide to reinstate Jake and Gramps, as well as give Jake his powers back. Still mournful over finding out Rose is the Huntsgirl, and thus being forced to shun her affections, Jake is kidnapped by The Huntsclan along with other magical creatures as part of their "Grand Equinox Hunt," where they are set free to be hunted down by the Huntsclan. When he doesn't drop subtle hints at Rose about the true nature of their relationship, he realizes that as a dragon, he must help a water-fearing mermaid, a hot-blooded brownie, a giantess, and an unlucky Leprechaun to defend themselves in the hunt. Jake's little sister is about to lose her first tooth. But since it's a dragon tooth, it has mystical powers. The Tooth Fairy's assistant, Dr. Diente, has been biding his time until a dragon tooth came along. Seizing his opportunity, Diente grabs the Tooth Fairy's wand and goes after Haley. But he didn't figure on a mystical shield guarding the Long house, as well as the American Dragon. Jake's father takes Jake, Spud, and Trixie camping. Although his friends are having fun, Jake is embarrassed by his dad's attempts to "be cool". While out in the woods, Jake is called on by a group of sprites to protect them from a beast that raids their village: The Jersey Devil. Episode One The NHRA POWERade Series goes to Vegas.

As she digs deeper at her family's summer home and at the newspaper offices, she finds in her visions that the truth is uglier than she realized, and it has nothing to do with Lucas. After another run-in with Merlyn, Sheriff Buck conjures up the spirit of the Boston Strangler, Albert DeSalvo, to deal with her once and for all.

Yancy attacks the sheriff at his house, stabbing him in in "third eye," but before he dies, Lucas whispers something to Caleb. With the sheriff then dead, Caleb turns into a monster in his place. Later, in Lucas' grave, though, the sheriff wakes up! A plague hits Trinity, and Dr. Crower becomes infected and starts going wild, ranting about repentance.

Matt Crower is haunted by the memories of his wife Lily and his daughter Claire, who died because of his drunk-driving crash.

Caleb, meanwhile, is intrigued by his elderly neighbor whom he thinks has buried a body in his pumpkin patch. Gail tells Lucas she's leaving town, with Caleb, but then discovers she's pregnant with Lucas' child! But is the sheriff still wrapped up in Selena? Is Selena still in love with the sheriff? That seems to be the suspicion, as Dr. Peale asks Selena to go away with him to Uganda to work among the needy. She pulls a no-show at the airport.

Follows legendary hog hunter Jerry Campbell, 64, his level-headed son, Robert, 28, and firecracker daughter, Krystal, 23, as they respond to those threatened by feral hogs. Located in the heart of Texas, the family dedicates itself to the front lines - riding horseback, driving a custom-rigged Jeep, using highly trained dogs with GPS tracking systems and employing good old-fashioned know-how to help those endangered by these destructive beasts. Clad in chaps and cowboy boots, the family sets out in each episode to square off against these extremely intelligent animals that are terrorizing helpless landowners. After nearly facing defeat on the 4R Ranch, the Campbells gear up for one last stand. Scouting from a helicopter, Jerry thinks he may have finally found where the elusive hogs have been hiding. But on the ground, their luck changes for the worse when the pack of aggressive hogs takes Robert, Krystal, and Lea by surprise, forcing them into a battle for their lives. After winning last season's showdown, Jerry Campbell is the Hog Boss in Texas. Business is booming, but Krystal, Robert and Lea aren't seeing any of the profits. They all point to Jerry's new hobby of "investing" in Texas "artifacts" as the main reason. The Campbells tackle their biggest job yet: a ranch so overrun with hogs, the owners are on the verge of selling the property. But the size of the ranch has Jerry worried about the safety of taking the job. On the hunt, Jerry finds signs of massive numbers of aggressive hogs, but the property is so large the kids are out of radio range. After only a few days into their new job, the Creek Boys have had about enough of Ronnie's obsession with taking down Jerry Campbell. It all comes to a head when he leads the guys on a wild chase into a barn because he thinks he saw "Hogzilla. The Campbells are faced with their biggest job yet: a 900-acre deer hunting ranch overrun with boars. Hoping to increase their hog hunting arsenal, Robert sinks more money into the family business by buying a hog trap. Jerry, who prefers hunting exclusively with dogs, forces Robert to prove the value of his investment by challenging him to a $1000 wager over who will catch the most hogs. With their usual hand, Leah, unavailable, Robert hires a young hand to help out the family, but Krystal and Jerry aren't sure the new kid has what it takes to make it as a hog hunter. The Campbells and their new hire take on the job, but when Krystal's threatened by a hog, Robert makes a split second decision that leaves his sister more angry than grateful. While Krystal and Lea battle cacti and barbed wire in an all-out fight to land a hog on the watermelon farm, Jerry is done feeling soft for her and says he's going to give her some tough love. It's the second time Jerry and Robert have faced off against the girls on the same property, but this will be the first time that Katie's in the picture. So it's game on. After seeing Krystal at the Campbell homestead, Jerry is really starting to miss his baby girl, and wonders if he could ever truly replace "Krystal the Pistol." He takes his angst out on Katie when she's late to work; there's seems to be nothing she can do to appease Jerry on the all-important Dean Smith job. Meanwhile, Krystal takes her pistol into a pawn shop with high hopes for a high-dollar sale, but the final deal falls short of the amount the girls need to get their Jeep out of repo jail. Luckily, the girls get a job on an exotics ranch where they aren't allowed to use dogs--instead, Krystal breaks out her semi-automatic, and Lea slings arrows. After the loss of his lead hunting dog, Rooster, Jerry is ready to call off his hunting days for awhile while he trains a new dog. But Krystal and Robert are desperate to keep their fledgling business alive. Against Jerry's advice, Robert invests in new dogs Creager and Lugnut hoping they can lead the pack. The Campbells get a call from an elderly widow being terrorized by a massive 250 pound boar. At the job, the battle between Jerry's old ways and the kids' new methods turns the hunt into a family feud that descends into chaos. In order to catch the giant hog, the Campbells will have to work together and agree on an approach. Jerry is thrilled with Katie's progress, and initiates her into the Campbell clan by giving her a six-shooter bearing the family crest. Katie takes the gesture a little too literally: she goes to shoot a hog surrounded by dogs, and Robert has to step in to stop her. Jerry chalks it up to a teaching moment. But Robert is a little less forgiving--until he faces a feisty hog, and Katie comes to his aid. In Florida, Tom and the girls are on the trail of a cash hog that could pay off the remainder of the girls' Jeep, but in the heat of the hobble, Tom stabs the hog dead. Have the girls finally had enough? The Campbells and their team of young dogs tee off at a Texas golf course, where an aggressive hog is threatening golfers and tearing up $20,000 greens. But the hunt leaves Krystal and Robert concerned about Jerry's health and ability to keep hunting. Lifelong Texan Jerry Campbell has been in the hog hunting game for over half a century. His kids, Robert and Krystal, are hoping to turn Dad's lifestyle into a full-time family business helping desperate landowners clear their property of destructive wild boars that are causing millions of dollars in damage. After taking to the internet to find new customers, Robert and Krystal find a hog hunting job at a local vineyard. But working close to the delicate grape vines forces the family to replace Jerry's traditional hunting methods with Robert's new strategy. Never happy to take a backseat, Jerry looks for hunting work in the farming community of Haskell, Texas. The girls are off to another job, and meet with a couple who claim they've spotted Bigfoot on their land, and mimic its call. While on the hunt, the girls hear something suspicious, and as Lea pulls her gun, culprit Jerry busts out of the brush. Jerry wishes he had Krystal back on the team, but he knows he's got to lean on Katie as the team plugs away on the Dean Smith job. Krystal and Lea continue to struggle on the watermelon farm and get a big shock when the farmer tells them he's bringing in someone else to help--Jerry Campbell!

Twelve finalists and/or future singers (six men and six women) who were selected from America, compete in a talent contest in which they were asked to sing any song they like on this "Star Search" clone. After each song that was sung, the judges, Abdul, Jackson and Cowell, then critique that finalist's chosen song. After each show's ending, America must vote for a finalist to whom they really think their performance is good using this AT&T (now Cingular Wireless) or any other cellular phone to cast votes with. Once the votes are locked in, the judges and America decides who has the most and the least amount of votes, and the contestant with the least amount of votes is eliminated, and it goes on each week's show until the winner is crowned as "American Idol," where he/she wins a recording contract worth up to $1,000,000. The rest of the other finalists to whom they have been voted off before (the runner-up) also get recording contracts, too. Theme: Songs From the Year In Which Contestants Were Born.

Some of the featured subjects included documentaries, dramas of classic literature pieces, stage preformances and panel discussions. Later in the series, the focus was shifted toward showing the work of various professions that supposedly made the world a better place.
null Hosted by evening tabloid veteran Nancy Glass, this show was not especially different from others in its genre. Typical subjects reported included celebrity scandals, updates on someof the more sensational crimes occurring around the country, and dire warnings about various new hazards that would supposedly endanger us all. Richard William Caamano was one of the first men in the U.S.A. to undergo a "buckle fat excision", a form of cosmetic surgery, which was performed by Dr. Andrew Ordon, to make Rich's face look thinner.

While hunting for wild pigs the Correas catch the Outsiders on one of their trails.

Kathleen Bush earned the nation's sympathy and admiration as she struggled to care for her grievously sick child. 8 year-old Jennifer was afflicted, her mother claimed, with a variety of complaints, including a rare intestinal condition that had required over 200 hospital stays and nearly 40 surgeries. With no health insurance, Jennifer's family was devastated financially. Largely through the publicity her mother drew to her plight, Jennifer became the "poster child" for health care reform in the early 1990s. Kathy Bush courted so much attention for her chronically ill daughter that the family met with Hillary Clinton and testified before Congress. Then, in a shocking twist, Jennifer's long-suffering mother was arrested on the unthinkable charge of child abuse. Investigators alleged that Kathy Bush had created her daughter's medical problems because she suffered from Munchausen's Syndrome By Proxy (MSBP), a rare phenomenon in which a parent-usually a mother-makes a child ill because the parent craves attention. At the same time of Kathy's arrest, little Jennifer was immediately taken from her mother and placed in foster care. Within weeks, the child's health was restored. Kathleen Bush was convicted of both child abuse and organized fraud, and sentenced to 5 years in prison. Now serving her time, Kathy maintains her innocence and says she is guilty only of keeping Jennifer alive, and that she is the victim. - of the hospital, its vengeful nursing staff, and a state agency that exacted revenge when she complained about them. He dazzled football fans with his fast moves and outstanding receptions-wide receiver Rae Carruth was a rising star in the NFL, and a local celebrity in Charlotte, North Carolina where he was the first round draft pick for the Carolina Panthers. But in 1999, it all came crashing down, when Rae Carruth was accused of masterminding the drive-by shooting death of his pregnant girlfriend, Cherica Adams. His lawyer claimed Rae Carruth had nothing to do with the shooting, that it was all the result of a drug deal gone bad. But a prosecutors said the victim herself told a different story, in a 911 tape and in notes written in the hospital-evidence the prosecution said made her the star witness in the trial of her accused killer. Conspiracy to Kill: The Rae Carruth Story details the sensational trial and includes an interview with the triggerman who confessed to the shooting while fingering Rae Carruth as the man who plotted the murder. In the spring of 1997, 16-year-old Terence Garner was arrested and charged with armed robbery and attempted murder. With no physical evidence liking him to the crime, the North Carolina teen was convicted on the basis of eyewitness testimony. Just days after the conviction, a different Terrance confessed to the crime. Despite the confession, Garner spent five years behind bars waiting to be acquitted. Today Garner is a free man and only one eyewitness remains vocally convinced of his guilt, the woman he was accused of shootings. The ordeal began when three men robbed the Quality Finance Company, a small loan company in rural Johnston County, North Carolina. Quality Finance employee Alice Wise was shot in the head and chest. She survived and went on to provide powerful eyewitness testimony that Garner was the gunman. The other two men arrested in connection with the crime, Keith Riddick and Kendrick Hederson, both admitted to their role in the robbery, yet told vastly different stories at Garner's trial. Riddick, in exchange for a reduced prison sentence, testified for the prosecution that Terence Garner was the shooter. Henderson, testifying for the defense, told the court Garner was innocent. He then repeated the same information he gave police nine months earlier: the shooter was Riddick's cousin Terrance from New York. Garner was found guilty and sentenced to a minimum of 32 years. After the trial, Henderson convinced a police officer from a neighboring jurisdiction to check out his claim that the wrong Terence had been convicted. Acting on Henderson's information, a Wayne County detective found 24-year-old Terrance Deloach. Deloach confessed to shooting Wise, but then recanted setting in motion a chain of events that reveal disturbing cracks in the American Justice system and call into question the reliability of eyewitness testimony. Documentary about the Jonesboro school massacre which occurred on Tuesday, March 24, 1998. The show depicts how 4 students and a teacher were killed by 2 armed middle school boys in Jonesboro a town in northeastern Arkansas. Mitchell Johnson, 13, and Andrew Golden, 11, pulled a school fire alarm and fired into the crowd as people filed out of the Westside Middle School, killing four girls and a teacher, and wounding 9 others. In August 1998, they were both sentenced to confinement until they reached the age of 21, the maximum under Arkansas law. The docudrama searches for clues to what happened and how to prevent similar tragedies in the future. The punishment the boys received led to changes in Arkansas' juvenile justice laws. On January 26th, 2001, 33-year-old Diane Whipple was mauled to death by her neighbors' dogs in the hallway of her San Francisco apartment building. The brutal attack shocked residents of the city, and Whipple, young, prosperous and gay, quickly captured the public's sympathy. But what was first seen as a tragic accident soon took on a more sinister tone. The dogs' owners, Marjorie Knoller and Robert Noel, husband-and-wife attorneys, began making statements that seemed to suggest Whipple herself might have been to blame for the attack. And when information surfaced that the couple's dogs had a history of violent behavior, the public began clamoring for justice, culminating in criminal charges against Knoller and Noel. In 1997 Vincent Doan is convicted of kidnapping and murdering his 22-year old girlfriend, Carrie Culberson, even though her body has never been found. Doan claims the former cheerleader vanished along with her red Honda in late August 1996. He believes he was wrongly convicted and that Carrie is still alive. But authorities say Doan ran with a tough crowd and had a record of alleged abuse. Police and prosecutors are confident the right man is behind bars and that Carrie is dead. Doan's father, half-brother, and even the police chief were also accused of helping to cover-up the crime. The small village of Blanchester, Ohio, outside of Cincinnati, remains divided as both families continue their endless search for the truth and for Carrie Culberson. This 2 hour special examines the successful defense strategy in the 1994 O. J. Simpson murder trial: a police conspiracy based on racism.

Interspersed are clips from Peck's films and from interviews recorded over the years and vï¿½ritï¿½ contemporary footage of visiting with his daughter Cecilia before and after the birth of her son, receiving the National Medal of Arts, chatting with Lauren Bacall and with Martin Scorsese, and dining with Jacques Chirac, always with his wife of forty-four years, Veronique Passani, beside him. Throughout, Peck is informal, candid, and wry. For the first time, American Masters profiles a sports figure: Billie Jean King, a determined woman who has been a major force in changing and democratizing the cultural landscape. American Masters Billie Jean King premieres nationally Tuesday, September 10, 2013 at 8 p.m. on PBS (check local listings) to commemorate the 40th anniversaries of the Billie Jean King v. Bobby Riggs "The Battle of the Sexes" match on Sept. 20, 1973, and the founding of the Women's Tennis Association (WTA) by King on June 20 of that year. This new documentary traces the incredible life of the single most important female athlete of the 20th century as her 70th birthday nears. American Masters looks back to the 12-year-old Long Beach, California, girl who played tennis on public courts, observed disparity and, as she soared athletically, never stopped trying to remedy inequality. During her professional tennis career, King won 39 Grand Slam titles, helped form the Virginia Slims Series (pre-cursor to WTA Tour), founded the Women's Sports Foundation and Women's Sports magazine, and co-founded World TeamTennis (WTT). Her competitiveness on the circuit was matched by her efforts on behalf of women and the LGBT community, and her commitment to prove there is strength in diversity. In American Masters Billie Jean King, King presents her own story with perspective from fellow tennis stars that played alongside her or were influenced by her, among them Margaret Court, Chris Evert, Ilana Kloss (King's partner), Maria Sharapova, Serena and Venus Williams, Caroline Wozniacki, and members of the Virginia Slims Circuit "Original 9," including Peaches Bartkowicz, Rosie Casals, Julie Heldman, Nancy Richey, and Valerie Ziegenfuss. The film also features new interviews with a diverse cast of characters from King's unparalleled life: former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, friend and fellow activist Sir Elton John, feminist icon Gloria Steinem, Bobby Riggs' son Larry and "Battle of the Sexes" trainer Lornie Kuhle, King's brother Randy Moffitt and ex-husband Larry King, and Valerie Jarrett, Senior Adviser to President Obama, who chose King as the first female athlete to be awarded with the Presidential Medal of Freedom. King is also a member of the President's Council on Fitness, Sports and Nutrition. Through these interviews and archival footage, the film illustrates the life of a woman whose journey became not just a battle for personal glory but a sociopolitical battle for equality for all. A one-hour profile of Billy Wilder, the writer-director whose movies include "Double Indemnity", "The Lost Weekend", "Sunset Blvd.", "Ace in the Hole", "Stalag 17", "Sabrina", "The Seven Year Itch", "Witness for the Prosecution", "Some Like It Hot", "The Apartment", "Irma La Douce", "The Fortune Cookie" and "The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes". Included: clips from those films; comments from Wilder, Walter Matthau (who also narrates), Jack Lemmon, Shirley MacLaine, Nancy Olson, I.A.L. Diamond, Audrey Wilder, critic Richard Schickel, and writer-directors Robert Towne, William Friedkin and Ron Shelton. Comedienne 'Carol Burnett' (qv)'s early show business aspirations were to perform in live theater on Broadway, craving the instant gratification from a live audience. Her sensibilities were shaped by going to "happy" movies in the 1940s and 1950s, the story lines for which made it seem like anything was possible. These movie going experiences were in part a mechanism to escape her difficult home life, which was nonetheless loving. Based on her early work, professionals around her saw her comedic talents and steered her in the direction of stand-up and sketch comedy. Her life in sketch comedy on television, both on _"The Garry Moore Show" (1958)_ (qv) and her own show, _"The Carol Burnett Show" (1967)_ (qv) was one of fun and play acting, which translated to what the audience saw. Her own show was pioneering as she was the first woman to host her own sketch comedy show. Unlike most sketch players, she relished in the interaction with her audience as seen through the Q&A's on her show. One thing she was uncomfortable with was her singing, a character which she needed to hide behind to feel comfortable to sing. Some say that there is a fine line between comedy and tragedy, with her fine dramatic acting skills displayed in such television movies as _Friendly Fire (1979) (TV)_ (qv) and _Seasons of the Heart (1994) (TV)_ (qv). Tragedy unfortunately struck her personal life in having to deal with a drug addicted daughter, 'Carrie Hamilton (I)' and after Carrie's drug recovery her untimely death at age 38 from cancer. Documentary that explores actor/director Clint Eastwood and his art by juxtaposing each major stage in his life with a corresponding stage in the thematic development of his work. Clint Eastwood tells his own story, from his childhood in Depression-era Northern California, to life in the stratosphere of fame and fortune. He's torn up the wild West, patrolled the mean streets of San Francisco, and even gone into outer space. Follow the on-screen and off-screen life of the Oscar-winning film icon in this retrospective PBS "American Masters" 2000 documentary filled with film clips, archival material and interviews. Clint's "Unforgiven" co-star Morgan Freeman narrates. The dramatic story of eminent photographer Edward S. Curtis and the creation of his monumental portfolio of Native American images. Descendants of his photographic subjects tell stories about the photos and reveal their meaning to Indian people today. Born in Brooklyn, the son of Russian Jewish immigrants, Danny Kaye went from a borscht belt comedian to one of the best known film and stage stars in the world. This tribute follows his career from the early years through film and stage success in the United States and London. Finally, his own television show, and recognition for a lifetime of excellence. A documentary on the film director William Wyler (1902-1981), this feature was conceived by his daughter, Catherine, as a loving tribute to him. Utilizing a wealth of film clips, many in black and white, the movie features interviews with Bette Davis, Samantha Eggar, Greer Garson, Lillian Hellman, Audrey Hepburn, Charleton Heston, John Huston, Laurence Olivier, Gregory Peck, Ralph Richardson, Terence Stamp, Barbra Streisand, Billy Wilder, Talli (the former Margaret Tallichet) Wyler, and the director himself. Some of the best of the Hollywood commentary comes from Wyler himself, interviewed only a few days before he died in 1981. From PBS and American Masters - More than four decades of 20th-century America are filtered through Lange's life and lens -- her creations and achievements; her tragedies and losses. Known for her powerful images from the Great Depression; her haunting "Migrant Mother" remains emblematic of that period. In 1936; when photographs of the poverty-stricken mother of seven; stranded in a camp in California; were published; a national awareness began. As America matured into a world power; Lange continued to bear witness -- mass migration; increasing urbanization and the cost of war at home -- bringing subjects alive; transmitting raw emotions and capturing the human condition. This film is made by Dyanna Taylor; Lange's granddaughter; who began her artistic vision; literally; at Lange's feet. America's foremost humorist and commentator, Garrison Keillor takes his skits and jokes, music and monologues across the country in his traveling radio show, spinning his stories into American gold. This freeform, intimate look at the private man in the public spotlight goes behind the scenes of America's most popular radio show, A Prairie Home Companion, and inside the imagination of the man who created it. Over one year of filming has resulted in an unusual portrait that cannot be defined by the standard terms of chronological biography: the subject himself is an enigma, and the fictional world he has created has become a real place in America: Lake Wobegon. A man compelled to speak for his people with humor and nostalgia; Keillor singlehandedly revived the art of live radio for generations of fans by creating an onstage world that deeply resonates with his audiences. His take on America is both pungent and poignant. In the best tradition of Will Rogers and Mark Twain, Keillor mixes storytelling and humor to give us a lighthearted but deeply felt reflection of ourselves. A look at the life, the work, and the contributions of Gene Kelly to movies and movie making. The film celebrates Kelly's putting story-telling into dance and discovering, along with Martha Graham and Jerome Robbins, an American style. It examines his partnership with Stanley Dolan, his bringing of tap and ballet into musicals, his marriages and personal competitiveness, his political views, and his work on stage as well as in film. This production details his contributions as a dancer, choreographer, and director. The narration and talking heads also discuss his muscular style, his low center of gravity, and his masculine appeal. Documentary on the legendary Hollywood movie mogul, who created his own independent production company to produce such classics as Dodsworth, Stella Dallas, Wuthering Heights, The Little Foxes, Pride of the Yankees, and The Best Years of Our Lives, among many others. Based on the biography by A. Scott Berg. For 50 years, Charles M. Schulz captivated and comforted millions with PEANUTS-his innovative daily chronicle of cruelty, hope, and heartbreak in the younger set. But unprecedented worldwide success did not quiet his own Charlie-Brown-style doubts. Instead, the outwardly mild-mannered Schulz relentlessly revisited the turbulent realities of his lost childhood in search of elusive answers. Like Citizen Kane (a film Schulz watched up to 40 times), GOOD OL' CHARLES SCHULZ tries to decipher an iconic, enigmatic American success story. Interviews with those who knew him best-including the real-life Linus and Little Red-Haired Girl-propel this 90-minute documentary. With full access to Peanuts strips and specials and to Schulz's personal archives, the film explores his life, his work, and the complex ways the two intersected. Filmed in wide screen, GOOD OL' CHARLES SCHULZ also connects the cartoons to the fading world of his Midwestern youth in visually innovative ways. A history of Memphis' Sun Records, the legendary label that started the careers of such rock and country icons as 'Elvis Presley' (qv), 'Carl Perkins (I)' (qv), 'Johnny Cash (I)' (qv), 'Jerry Lee Lewis' (qv) and many others. Included are archival footage and interviews with many rock and country artists who either recorded for Sun or knew owner 'Sam Phillips (I)' (qv). In this film, we explore the life, career and art of silent cinema's third major talent after Charles Chaplin and Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd. We learn of his rise from a mere Chaplin rip off actor to a stellar talent when he found his own style of comedy which often involved outrageous stunts he performed even after his left hand was disfigured in an accident. Henry Luce co-founded Time Inc. in 1923 and presided over the company for more than 45 years, making an indelible mark on publishing in the process. This compelling look into the life of the publishing icon includes photographs and news footage from the company's unparalleled archives, readings from ground-breaking essays, and firsthand accounts from those who knew Luce best to provide insight into his life, work, and influence on America. David Geffen's far-reaching influence - as agent, manager, record industry mogul, Hollywood and Broadway producer, and philanthropist - has helped shape American popular culture for the past four decades. Notoriously press and camera-shy, Geffen reveals himself for the first time. Born Jerome Wilson Rabinowitz, 'Jerome Robbins' (qv) was a dancer and choreographer. Starting his career as a modern dancer, he began to appreciate the technique involved in ballet, the two which he merged in his choreography, especially in musical theater. In his choreography, he was renowned for injecting personality into each individual dancer's role and integrating dance not only into the storyline but into the everyday movement of the character. His primary interest was in telling American stories through dance. His professional career finished more the modern ballet realm. He was a taskmaster and perfectionist which invoked from those he worked with a mixture of admiration, praise and from some hatred. In both his professional and personal life, he was prone to self-doubt and self-loathing. In the latter half of his career and life, some of this feeling stemmed from his testimony provided to the House Un-American Activities Committee. This documentary illustrates the life of John Muir, the father of the Sierra Club and the first American preservationist. The film includes beautiful scenery and was shot at many locations including Wisconsin (where Muir grew up), Florida, Yosemite, Alaska, etc. This interesting and well done PBS documentary includes interviews with historians, archival photographs and spectacular recreations of hikes. Chronological look at the life and career of Johnny Carson (1925-2005), with commentary from an ex-wife and more than 30 fellow comedians, friends, employees, and biographers. The biography defines why Carson was an enduring star (his cool, his timing, his genuine laugh, his breadth of knowledge) and pursues his motivations and inner self (a loner with a drinking problem, a decent Midwesterner whose mother withheld approval, a quiet person who loved to entertain). The key to understanding him, argues the biography, is his love of magic. The Authorized biography of Les Paul, " The Wizard of Waukesha". The name Les Paul is synonymous with the electric guitar. As a player, inventor, and recording artist(Paul had two #1 hits with his wife Mary Ford), Paul has been and innovator from the early years of his life. In 1928, thirteen-year-old Les Paul borrowed a phonograph needle from the family Victrola, stuck it under the strings of his Sear Roebuck guitar, and wired the contraption to a telephone mike and two radio speakers, thus achieving not only amplification but a crude stereo effect. The pioneering young musician then went on to invent scores of ingenious recording techniques, including overdubbing and multi-track recorders, as well as the solid-body electric guitar at the heart of the rock and roll revolution. Still spry at age 90, Les Paul tells his own classic rags-to-riches story in a feature-length HD documentary-with a soundtrack of greatest hits from Bing Crosby, Chet Atkins, B.B. KIng, and rock legends Jimi Hendrix, Jeff Beck, Jimmy Page, Keith Richards and Paul McCartney. Maurice Sendak,the renowned illustrator is no stranger to television. He has been featured on "magazines" such as "60 Minutes." His "Really Rosie!" published in the 1950's, was seen as an animation special long before being adapted for a stage musical. Still undaunted, however, he returns this evening at 9 on WNET to sit for a portrait in "Mon Cher Papa." This hour long program is a presentation of "American Masters," a weekly anthology of profiles on this country's leading figures in the creative arts. In 60-years in show business, he has earned more awards than any other living entertainer. A comedy giant of our time, Melvin Kaminsky developed his aggressively funny personality on the streets of Brooklyn, and the Catskill Mountains, before landing a writers job on the legendary "Your Show of Shows". The first "2000 Year Old Man" album, recorded with Carl Reiner in the early '60s, unleashed his wacky mind on the world. His brazen satirical film "The Producers" won the 1968 Oscar for best screenplay and such cult classics as "Blazing Saddles", "Young Frankenstein", and "High Anxiety" followed. Brooks has never participated in a biography before and requested that his friends not talk about him - until now - making this film a genuine first. Portrait of an artist as a young man. Roughly chronological, using archival footage intercut with recent interviews, a story takes shape of Bob Dylan's (b. 1941) coming of age from 1961 to 1966 as a singer, songwriter, performer, and star. He takes from others: singing styles, chord changes, and rare records. He keeps moving: on stage, around New York City and on tour, from Suze Rotolo to Joan Baez and on, from songs of topical witness to songs of raucous independence, from folk to rock. He drops the past. He refuses, usually with humor and charm, to be simplified, classified, categorized, or finalized: always becoming, we see a shapeshifter on a journey with no direction home. Director 'Elia Kazan' (qv) and playwright 'Arthur Miller (I)' (qv) were once best friends and professional colleagues, to most that knew them then in both capacities as soul mates. Their politics were similar which was reflected in their work. Kazan was a Communist Party member for a few years in the mid-1930's, but Miller never officially joined the party ranks. Their relationship changed in the early 1950's when Kazan was subpoenaed to testify in front of the House Un-American Activities Committee. To the Committee, Kazan named names of supposed friends - albeit names the Committee already had - but for many, including Miller, Kazan's move was both an act of support of the Committee's blacklisting, and a purely self-preserving measure for his own movie directing career. Kazan's professional life, and by association personal life, was not an easy one following his testimony. Both Kazan and Miller's individual works following - most specifically Kazan's _On the Waterfront (1954)_ (qv), Miller's "The Crucible" and "A View from the Bridge", and their collaboration on "After the Fall" - were direct responses to Kazan's act in front of the Committee. 'Marilyn Monroe' (qv), Miller's wife in the late 1950's and a past lover of Kazan's, also played an integral role in both their lives in relationship to the affect of Kazan's testimony, and Miller's own testimony to the Committee four years after Kazan's. Widely thought of as "a woman's director," legendary film director George Cukor is profiled in this "American Masters" 2000 documentary narrated by Jean Simmons and featuring clips from such beloved classics as "Dinner at Eight," "David Copperfield," "The Women," "The Philadelphia Story," "Little Women," "Camille," "Born Yesterday," "Gaslight," "Adam's Rib," "A Double Life," "A Star is Born," and his Oscar-winning "My Fair Lady." The documentary uses film clips and interviews with Cukor's friends and colleagues including director Peter Bogdanovich, critic Richard Schickel, writer Fay Kanin, and Cukor's biographer Gavin Lambert himself as well as actors Mia Farrow, Shelley Winters, Angela Lansbury, Jack Lemmon and Claire Bloom to provide a picture of the director's unique accomplishments and to trace the arc of his career. As for his private life, the discreet director remains silent, and despite the film's references to his gay poolside parties at his Hollywood home, intimate friends and colleagues fail to recall anything about his sexuality that sheds light on his work. Career biography of architect Philip Johnson, largely told through conversation with arts editor/critic Rosamond Bernier. Includes scenes shot at Johnson's famous "glass house", his private painting and sculpture galleries, his studio, the garden of the Museum of Modern Art, the Four Season Restaurant in New York City, and various buildings he designed all over America. This documentary was in the first season of the WNET/PBS television series "American Masters." American Masters explores the life and career of Pulitzer Prize- and National Book Award-winning novelist Philip Roth, often referred to as the greatest living American writer. Reclusive and diffident, Roth grants very few interviews, but for the first time, allowed a journalist to spend 10 days interviewing him on camera. The result is Philip Roth: Unmasked, a 90-minute documentary that features Roth freely discussing very intimate aspects of his life and art as he has never done before. The film has its world theatrical premiere March 13-19 for one week only at Film Forum in New York City and premieres nationally Friday, March 29 on PBS (check local listings) in honor of Roth's 80th birthday. An examination of the life and influence of writer Ralph Ellison, whose only novel "Invisible Man" was a watershed work in African-American literature. Dramatic recreations from the novel are featured to complement the perspectives of several major African-American writers and scholars on Ellison's role regarding the continuing issue of race in America; Toni Morrison reads excerpts from Ellison's uncompleted second novel "Juneteenth." Biography of Will Rogers, who, during the generation before World War Two, was one of America's best known journalists, movie actors, stage performers and international ambassadors of good will. The story is told through interviews, photographs, newsreel clips and excerpts from feature films in which he starred. Narrated by Edwin Newman. American Masters examines the life and work of television writer and producer Rod Serling. It focuses on his life and war experience, his early writing during the Golden Age of television drama, and his work writing and producing the popular fantasy series 'The Twilight Zone'. It also examines his later television and film work on 'Seven Days in May', 'The Loner', and 'The Night Gallery'. In this series entry, actor/director Sidney Poitier discusses his life and career. He tells of his upbringing in Jamaica; the difficulties he encountered in New York City at the start of his career; his involvement in the US civil-rights movement; and efforts to end apartheid in South Africa. Friends and acquaintances, as well as other performers, give their insights about what makes him so special. A look at the life and career of architect Frank Gehry (1929 - ), a visit to four buildings (the Vitra Museum in Germany, Maggie's Centre, the Guggenheim in Bilbao, and the Disney Concert Hall in L.A.), and an inquiry into creativity in conversations between Ghery and Sidney Pollack, whom Gehry asked to make this picture. Early experiences (playing with blocks with his grandmother, drawing with his father, hearing Alvar Aalto lecture), discovering computer-assisted design, finding a psychoanalyst, experimenting on his own home, and bringing an artist and sculptor's sensibility to architecture are part of Gehry's story. Friends, artists, critics, and curators comment. Filmmaker Stanley Nelson captures the history of African-American a cappella group Sweet Honey In The Rock and follows their 30th anniversary concert tour. The film includes footage from concerts, rehearsals, the tour bus and the daily life of the members: Carol Maillard seeing her son off to his high school prom, Nitanju Bolade Casel singing to her son in the morning, Ysaye Maria Barnwell leading a community singing workshop. After Bernice Johnson Reagon announces her retirement, the other members of Sweet Honey hold auditions for a new member. The movie includes the encore from their final concert with her performing with the group. A study of 'Tennessee Williams' (qv)'s life and work as a whole, ranging from his youth in Mississippi and in St. Louis to success and acclaim, followed by the final difficult years. Includes some of the most celebrated scenes from film adaptations of Williams' work, among them extracts of _Streetcar Named Desire, A (1951)_,_Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (1958)_ (qv), _Night of the Iguana, The (1964)_, and _Suddenly, Last Summer (1993) (TV)_. Contains footage of Williams being interviewed, including conversations with 'David Frost (I)' (qv), 'Edward R. Murrow (I)', and 'Melvyn Bragg' (qv), as well as reminiscences from people who knew and worked with him, among them 'Edward Albee' (qv), 'Gore Vidal' (qv), and his lifelong friend, Lady 'Maria St. Just' (qv). Features readings from 'Elia Kazan' (qv)'s Notebook by 'Kim Hunter (I)' (qv). This explores the life and work of the greatest poet of the Beat Generation. Along with the usual biographical details, we also get to experience the poet's readings of his work such as his masterwork, Howl. We also examine his work as a musician and a political activist who, amoung other causes, worked to end the Vietnam War. Profile of the group of writers and humorists who formed lasting friendships and collaborations centered on their daily lunches at New York City's Algonquin Hotel through the 1920s, which led to scathing satire of cultural and social trends of the Roaring '20s. Their conflicts and romances are explored, with central figures including Dorothy Parker and Alexander Woollcott. As the decade progressed, they increasingly found themselves drawn apart by literary ambitions, as well as by social issues including the Sacco and Vanzetti case. This cinematic portrayal of Tony Bennett caps a year-long celebration of a singer who celebrated his 80th birthday last August. Bennett's most recent chart topping CD, "Tony Bennett Duets: An American Classic," has also reached another milestone for the singer, becoming the biggest selling album of his career. "Duets" was awarded three Grammy Awards last Sunday in the categories of "Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album," "Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals" and "Best Instrumental Arrangement Accompanying Vocalist(s)." Examines the California singer/songwriter movement of the early 1970s, as seen through the eyes of two of its brightest lights: Carole King and James Taylor. Intimately tracking King and Taylor's artistic developments and enduring partnership, the film also interweaves the intriguing story of the 'world famous' Troubadour club that cemented their musical legacy. Run by a mercurial impresario named Doug Weston, the Troubadour was, for a time, the premier launching pad for the likes of King, Taylor, and other soon-to-be-boldfaced names: Jackson Browne; Elton John; Kris Kristofferson; David Crosby; even Steve Martin and Cheech & Chong. But 'Troubadors' also chronicles the dark side of the burgeoning L.A. music industry, evinced by hard drugs, critical opprobrium, and the eventual decay of the Troubadour itself. Walter Cronkite was the man who gave us the news for two tumultuous decades in the late 20th century. As historian, journalist and author David Halberstam says in praise of the great CBS newsman: "Most Americans really learned of the evening news and learned of Vietnam and learned of the civil rights movement and learned of Watergate with Walter Cronkite as the man who ushered it into their homes. And did it with great professionalism over a very long time and was I think absolutely true to himself." In AMERICAN MASTERS Walter Cronkite: Witness to History, a documentary narrated by Katie Couric, historians, fellow journalists and CBS colleagues appraise the career of the man who was called "the most trusted man in America." CBS writer and commentator Andy Rooney, legendary producer/director Don Hewitt, correspondents Mike Wallace, Morley Safer, Lesley Stahl and Barbara Walters, columnists Molly Ivins and Helen Thomas, Senator John McCain and President Jimmy Carter guide the viewer from Cronkite's early days as a foreign correspondent in World War II through his thirty-year career at CBS News. The film opens with Cronkite's beginnings as a journalist - his decision at the age of twelve to become the best possible reporter he could be. His ambition was honed during his early years with the United Press wire service. Battling constant deadlines, he developed a keen sense of competition - and a keen sense of what mattered to the American public. In the nascent years of television, when even the networks weren't sure what the medium could do, Cronkite was among the first to shine - as a newsman and as the host of the enormously popular You Are There series. Chosen to anchor the CBS Evening News, Cronkite would become involved in every major event of the post-war years: the assassination of John F. Kennedy, the Vietnam war and the anti-war movement, the race to space and the moon, the Watergate scandal and the impeachment of Richard Nixon, the Camp David peace accords between Egypt and Israel. When he retired from the anchor desk in 1981, the press viewed the event as the passing of an icon and an era. One magazine editor wrote that Walter Cronkite leaving the air was "like George Washington's face leaving the dollar bill." This documentary tells the story of a woman who invented herself from scratch. As a child, Willa Cather was taken from her comfortable home in Virginia into the wild Nebraska frontier--a place so vast and empty she felt "erased." Cather survived and even thrived on the plains, eventually pioneering her way east to New York City where she wrote her great novels: O Pioneers!, The Song of the Lark, My Antonia, Death Comes For the Archbishop and the Pulitzer Prize-winning One of Ours. Willa Cather: The Road Is All is a story of the transforming power of art, illustrating Cather's life through dramatic re-enactments of scenes from her most famous novels. A prime example of days when television was seen more as an extansion of the live stage, the program was essentially a vaudeville show performed in front of the cameras. Among the various musical and comedy numbers were such regulars as Pick and Pat, a pair of comics performing in blackface, Mary Small and Jimmy Burrell, who would sing current popular songs. This music show featured a different country artist each week. Concerts were given in a small, intimate theatre and recorded live. In addition to the artists' own bands, the American Music Shop band accompanied the performers, giving these concerts a unique sound.

Songs illustrate their state of mind, including his unwillingness to make life-determining choices at knave-age.

Casper arrives, but Oli's chicks-scoring-speech diverts him, then Casper is told to see Marie-Louise about the missing horses, to be told his job is canceled too.

Olivier is pleasantly surprised by Barry's manager, who likes his voice enough to consider recording a full CD. Gringo confirms to Chanel the lady photographed with Barry is her ma Kelly. Merel runs away screaming when Marie-Claire discovers Amika in the stables. By the time she gets her dad Herbert, John William and his pa the baron, the stallion has however been removed by Jan to a trailer.

Olivier overhears ma, clearly in panic, calls Jan to 'fix it' now Lodewijks is early for brat Jasmin's ride on Amika. She sneaks into the stables, but bumps into Herbert and discovers he hid a surprise there: the pink scooter Marie-Claire graves as birthday present. Merel feels guilty for lying to dad, who sweetly works on a birthday cake, but never manages to till him the truth. Olivier's film switch prank is crippled by Gringo's impatience. But after overhearing Jan about a mystery amazon who can beat Marie-Claire, he makes a deal: she'll do his homework all month if he finds out her identity, which he soon works out: Merel's late ma Sofie.

After the public boos clown Umberto's lame act, director Patricio threatens to fire him and acrobat Sandro unless the stunt on the stallion is performed stat. Although the training went miserably, Merel accepts to do it. Olivier's latest prank is a triumph, while Marie-Claire fears it lost her Casper for good. Jan refuses to tell even Merel what has hot row with Marie-Louise was about, in fact Amika's fate, which may involve Herbert's business connection Mathieu Lodewijks. Gringo and Chanel are discovered in the barn. Chanel's mucking punishment is lifted, Jan meanly blackmails Gringo to finish cleaning the stables. Now the sale of Amika to Riccardo is a done deal, except for the official papers, but already toasted on with champagne, the stud farm is preparing to host the prestigious national spring jumping. Herbert wants Marie-Claire to train hard and considers buying her a new champion. Jan convinces Merel that the only way to save Amika is riding the stallion, which nobody else seems able too at short notice. They agree to tell Herbert how the horse was ruined, even if that may cost his job. Instead Herbert tells Jan about the concluded sale and won't even hear the 'old story'. Barry takes Olli's advice and performs, to crowd-acclaim, a serenade to win back Chanel, who felt everyone lied to her, but afterward makes up with Gringo too. This example makes Marie-Louise admit Olli too might make a living as singer if their duet record proves a hit. Merel is late due to the play, but it brings enough money for the entrance fee.

Marie-Claire starts instructing Chanel about a plan for revenge on spoilsport Merel, by blaming her for Amika's frenzy.

Cindy arrives but isn't impressed by Marie-Claire's plan to seduce Oli. Riccardo comes to collect Amika. Merel bluffs she'll buy him, bidding 5,000 Euro the next day, but hasn't got a cent. Olivier volunteers to get the money by agreeing to the US tour, provided his manager Vos gives him an advance of that sum. Riccardo however senses more and demands the quadruple. Since Ricardo quadrupled his price at the last minute, even Oliver despairs, and indeed fails to get that much from Vincent. Oli confides into Cindy, who offers a private loan. Meanwhile Herbert must move out of the family's grand villa and find a cheap home, to his wife's horror with neighbors, but no suc luxury as a pool. Marie-Claire coaches Amika's potential buyer Ricardo to convince Herbert he's a well-willing horse-lover and -whisperer. To the stable-staff's disappointment, Herbert reluctantly accepts to sell. Gringo's hard work in the stables to help Chanel remains a mystery to her and Jan. Then she finds Gringo lying in the hey. Gringo makes Oli admit he has a crush on Merel and misses her now she's fired as stable-hand, so Gringo decides they must bring her Amika, or at least hand-deliver a video DVD. That allows MC to blackmail Oli out of his last cash. Ma tries to save on the household and mask it under French names, even the horses' feed, and decides to dump the entire stable. Tijs meanwhile arranged the Royal Academy will lend Merel another horse. . Lodewijk point out to Herbert that Ricardo is a dodgy, nearly criminal horse-trader, so the deal to sell him Amika is canceled.

Tijs and Saskia elaborately design a play, starring reluctant Merel as the Ugly Duckling. Ollie is invited by Hedwig to a fancy dance. Unfortunately, ballroom dancing isn't one of his talents, so she teaches him, ruthlessly. Herbert offers to sponsor Merel as Amika's jockey, but she and her dad Tijs are reluctant to accept his 'charity', so she pretends having sold all muffins. While Ollie's etiquette class torture continues at the dinner table, Marie-Claire boasts her debut CD to a radio station but dad says Amika isn't being sold, so she won't get a cent. Now Tijs knows about Merel's job, he forbids her to keep working in the stable. Jan also worries Herbert may sell stallion Amika. Not satisfied with her new wardrobe, Marie-Claire still wants Casper, who is dating another pupil, notary's daughter Florence. So she instructs Chanel to steal his agenda to sabotage the rival's dinner. Olivier painstakingly prevents Jan from feeding the horses so he can keep Amika's absence hidden. Elvis is naively impressed by 'croupier' Marie-Claire trough pure luck, despite ignoring Chanel's earpiece advice. Wheelchair girl convinces Merel she can handle Amika. Olivier is shocked that Marie-Claire gets permission for a Z Girls sleep-over 'to console her over Amika' while Gringo can't sleep with him 'to protect the girls privacy'. So they hatch a plan to secretly install a web-cam in sister's bedroom. Jan finally discovers his brat kid sister has absconded, in fact to Merel's to tell Amika is about to be sold. Marie-Claire offers the stallion to horse trader Ricardo de Bruyne, for pittance to avoid official examination. Girl-lover Olivier and his visitor Barry Palerma, who shows interest in Chanel and her ma, enjoy their hit single success. Thijs won't let Merel look after Amika. Marie-Claire is worried for the stallion too, but Jan's grandpa is giving it the best veterinarian care. Gringo shows his incriminating video recording to M-C, who promises him a date with Chanel if he doesn't show it. Olivier notices Gringo's heartache and encourages his buddy to tell all about it. He sees straight trough the "brother of a cousin's friend's love problems" and advices a heroic intervention. So Gringo does Chanel's stable chores in superman style. While planning again to separate Casper from Florence, Marie-Claire has forgotten all about horse buyer Ricardo, who just calls by dad Hubert. Jan learns Merel promised her dad never to ride a horse. Clever scamp Olivier has convinced his sister to take their alternative punishment but hit back by treating their honored guests, Lodewijks and his daughter in style, posh and overdressed. Jan is startled to hear that his sister has befriended his new assistant, and fears his father may discover the truth as he wants to visit the mall where she pretends to work. Alert Olivier brilliantly avoids Merel being discovered in his room when Marie-Claire comes to ask if he prefers a Porsche or a Ferrari.

Tijs comes ask Herbert about Merel's absence. Marie-Louise must now admit that Amika isn't in the stables. Cindy puts a call over the radio to announce a duet and half year US tour with Oli.

When MC tries to help, they both end up in the mud. When the stallion tamely walks up to Merel, Herbert asks her back, now as trainer. Even faking a Kazakh disease, Oliver can't get rid of Elise.

Olivier overhears his sister's star delusion while moving into the canteen, while her mother panics about her going 'missing'. Olivier tells Marie-Claire he knows a famous video clip director, a part for Gringo's mate Davy. Casper proves a rude and hardly helpful trainer for Merel, but Herbert checks on his efforts, while Jan secretly helps her. MC keeps spending like a star on image, and hires two bodyguards with orders to keep press, fans and especially her parents. Marie-Louise gets Herbert to help chase Olivier out of his barricaded room now he wants to stay in the country and take up Barry's manager Andrï¿½'s offer to record a full CD. But daddy rather reasons with and understands his rascal. Gringo is convinced the test proves Barry must be Chanel's dad. Although actually worrying about Amika and prodded by Jan to try the Academy test, Merel must help dad Tijs prepare the Ugly Duckling play. Jan overhears Gringo and M-C discuss the saddle video. To Olivier's disappointment, his celebrity womanizer charm didn't actually work on the reporter, while his manager scolds her article only descries him as such, without mentioning his songs, which could get him a celebrity duet. After Casper's consistent failure, the ladies have to accept the baron's son must be coached by Merel, whom Herbert re-hires, as no one else can handle Amika. Marie-Claire hopes to bug her away later, and recruits the other Z Girls as her (personal) assistants. Olivier finished the preparations for a 'cowboy party' starring Amika, but the stallion has a terrible off day, he won't even be saddled. The last hope is a mention in Merel's ma's diary about a magical saddle, owned by her former riding coach. So Oli drives with her to the vast forest where he lives according to the diary. The long ride and wood walk provide ample occasion for play and memories, partially in the form of country&Western-style songs. The old man is found and the saddle brought back just in time for the party. Olivier overhears coach Chris is programming an equitation instruction film. he decides to sneakily switch it with the recordings of the bumbling Z Girls, although Gringo feels that's a bit too cruel. Tijs's invention presentation goes badly, so he blames Merel for being too late. Barry's manager makes Olivier a fabulous offer: his own full CD, stat! Alas, ma just booked him lodgings to leave for Oxford the next day. Gringo makes Chanel realize that the year on the picture suggests Barry probably is her father. The shed owner who refused to put up Amika proves to Marie-Claire that Merel stole Amika. She rushes to tells Herbert, who can't believe the stallion is alive. Meanwhile Merel searches Jan and John William, so they can hide the horse again, but their trailer bumps on the baron and Herbert. Jan and John William try to take the blame, but Merel confesses and is fired again. Olivier fails to intercept his history's next phone call, so ma sends Grigo home and orders him to work, threatening half a year without TV or Internet. However the Amika secret is good enough to blackmail Marie-Claire into doing it for him. She basks in her evil triumph when Casper looses his job over the trap she set for him to insult and scare off potential sponsor Arian Van Dongeren. Herbert demotes Casper, Hedwig dumps him. Tijs stresses over the impending inventors contest. Jan continues training Merel. Olivier and Gringo cheer when their horse muck trap closes, but turn pale when they see intended target Jan enter from another direction. Marie-Claire is furious to see fellow Z Girl covered in smelly filth. Herbert considers a punishment for the perpetrators. Casper is innocently dumped by Florence because of the Z Girls. Tijs has entered an inventors fair but gets caught in his 'inflatable tent for two'. Olli and Gringo get in to party at last. They're just in time to see Merel trip and spill drinks over Casper's white suit. Amika is loose, remains quiet when passing Merel but spooked by a loud group of boys and Chanel's ma Kelly, who reports a 'wild horse', something the Lafayette girls must keep hidden from Herbert, but charge Jan with. Olli, Gringo and the sixteen year old-girls party on while Marie-Claire fails to keep her father pinned-down. He then finds out about Kelly's noisy complaints and realizes only Amika fits the monster's description, so Jan gets even more urgent instructions to find the stallion. Tijs gives his late wife's treasured doll house to Merel, who finds a key hidden inside and the box it opens. Oliver and Herbert are puzzled by Marie-Claire's tantrum when dad gives her the pink scooter, but ma convinces her to pretend gratitude to get her party later. Casper fails to wriggle out of training Lodewijks' brat Jasmin. Tijs bakes ma's birthday cake for Merel, although barely edible, and adds a pair of boots as gift. Jan is relieved when Julie tells him Merel is back and likes him, so he also treats her to a cozy drink in the stables. The stud farm is in trouble now the baron has walked off on account of the fake charity. Olivier convinces Merel she stands a good chance in the blind wall duel against his sister and unlike her gratefully accepts Jan's research on the terrible stunt. The Z Girls hatch a cheating plan: scaring Amika with a huge pig, or Chanel in a porcine suit. Herbert is back home and furious at his bumbling girls. The wealthy family De Lafayette lives a huge estate, most of which is a luxury horse ranch and riding school. Owner Herbert and his wife Marie-Louise spoil their daughter Marie-Claire rotten, while jolly son Olivier 'Oli' grows up a neglected rascal. With her birthday coming up, she wants to treat her two fashion-obsessed mates, forming a gang called the 'Z Girls', to a New York shopping weekend, actually to outclass what Hedwig Hendriksen recently got. Stablehand Jan warns her the expensive horse Amika, last year's present, is going to waste in an old barn. Meanwhile, neighboring naive widower Tijd De Ridder, a would be-inventor, can't make ends meet. His teenager daughter Merel decides to get a job, and prefers stable work, but dad is radically against that business. Gringo helps Olivier barricade his room to prevent Merel being discovered in there, then stages a brilliant diversion so she can actually escape while the Z Girls mount guard all around the villa. Herbert fails to talk Elivis out of selling the horse, or at least not Amika, to dodgy Ricardo, who grumpily grants him a short goodbye from the prize stallion. Olivier is delighted to get a response from absurd 'Timberlake-replacement' Barry Palerma. MC completely ignores dad's dinner invitation, absorbed by delusions about her 'star duet' and practicing for it, while even Chanel and Hedwig realize live sounds insufferably bad. Merel is desperately puzzled why Jan won't talk to her anymore. After singer Cindy threw the love-cocktail in Oliver's face, the knave takes it as a challenge. Her flat tie proves time enough to sort of change her mind, a duet is still on the cards. Meanwhile the Z Girls try to make Merel's job as stable-hand and Amika's trainer as hard as possible, sanctimoniously promising to be a 'good boss' while Herbert and wife insist the baron must get Amika for his son. Olivier is obviously miserable and worried about Merel. So much so that Cindy starts despairing and finally releases her hold and lets him go. Meanwhile Elvis is torn between his daughter Floortje's wish to revive the stud-farm with Amika, which Riccardo is willing to sell for a fortune, and Marie-Claire, who wants the casino project to go on and threatens that it's doomed without her as his 'luck-bringer'. Elvis breaks the tie by making her and Merel agree to a dare, a second death wall, for which each must hastily prepare. Oli does a brilliant job making sure Hedwig stresses about having reading his sister's diary, so she won't notice on the monitor how the drugged bodyguards collapse and are dragged away. Chanel however follows a bunny into the wood, thus bumping onto Tys's party, which got hold of Amika using smoke bomb diversion. Olie and Gringo seek a fake Justin Timberlake for their prank duet video clip with Em-Ce and decide on would be Barry Palermo, whom only Chanel still seems to be fan of. Merel gets desperate now Jan refuses to help or even speak her. Herbert comforting her puts Marie-Claire in another rage, so she concentrates of the imaginary duo concert with Justin Timberlake. Olivier is greatly amused to hear David still does a great job making Marie-Claire desperately nervous about her impending performance, this time doing a ruthless stage inspection. Merel gets desperate when Casper ignores her, but then Jan steps up. He uses a vamp 'rich Justin fan' to distract Casper, so he can train Merel himself. Meanwhile Gringo has brought in Barry Palerma, literally under cover. Gringo accidentally catches Merel in Oli's room but vows to keep their secret and is surprised neither realized their love is mutual. Cindy arrives to kiss startled Oli is tour partner. Herbert calls a family meeting to announce the stud farm's sale, including all horses and the villa, to Elvis, who joins them for a champagne toast. Only then the boys learn about the casino project and his partner, dodgy horse trader Ricardo De Bruyne, but that's a deal breaker for dad. 'Fan' Floortje distracts Cindy so Olivier can try to see Merel, whom Tijs forbids to meet Oli until she confesses the truth. Oli joins 'team De Ridder' for retaliation on horse-thief Riccardo. Marie-Claire plans to blackmail Riccardo. Six months later, Olivier still enjoys his singer star status, especially the adoring fans, more then enough to share some with Gringo. Dad Herbert plans a Chinese potato chips investment. Marie-Claire just finished her work punishment, as the horse farm's secretary, inspiring her new ambition, becoming the manager. She intercepted Merel's letter announcing she's eager to resume her stable-hand job. Jan worries because satisfactory replacement Lotte is expected to stay on instead. Unsuspecting Merel cheerfully rejoins her family after a glorious time at the Royal Academy in England. MC is terrified to discover her concert partner isn't superstar Justin Timberlake but nobody Barry Palerma, and the crowd boos them both. Olivier's enjoyment of her embarrassment is cut short when his crafty deception is discovered. Mother makes him explain on stage. Instead Olie instantly invents a successful double-act, which wins over crowd and press. Casper is determined to call Jan to order for interfering in his coaching of Merel, but Herbert finds out he left the job. And Casper finds outs Saskia was his siren. Olivier and Gringo eagerly film the show, especially girls in attendance, as everyone gather for the great spring jumping contest. Riccardo Lodewijks grudgingly accepts to receive his acquisition Amika afterward. Jaak Pijpen presents the show. Gringo show Chanel how Marie-Claire stole her place, but the bitch goes on and gets the best result with only one contestant left. Olivier enjoys Marie-Claire slaving all night on his history assignment and pretending at breakfast he made all that effort. She was looking forward to making Casper jealous with - or dumping her for the new head coach, Olympic medalist Chris Bogaerts, but the Z Girls are bitterly surprised. Jan continues his secret riding course. Olivier isn't amused when his manager warns he can't be seen with any girl but Cindy, not even Merel. Chanel is tricked into playing the pink suit pig to scare Amika, but the stallion ignores her 'scary' act, unlike Herbert. Merel confides only into Oli, who knows the stunt killed her ma, she was ignored when telling Marie-Claire the death wall is too dangerous, but was told the bet is still on: do it or leave the stud-farm forever. Jan worries for his ex too much to enjoy Lotte's fun plans. Hedwig and Marie-Claire sneakily play uninterested while secretly rivaling for John William. Jan tells Merel she can work in the stables again, to pay off some debt, which dad allows. Casper is back from the States. Barry takes Chanel riding again. He asks during a picnic if she isn't curious about her dad, then they get lost. Marie-Claire is furious about John William's appreciation for Merel, whom she forbids to care for her new horse Jewel. Chanel is worried ma Kelly will be furious when she gets lost riding with Barry. Marie-Claire puts Kelly on their trace, Herbert is commandeered to start a search. Even Jan can't help Almika's infected wound without drugs, so Merel goes steal some. Tijs is flat-out minding children. Because the profit is meager, Saskia suggests mounting a play instead. Olivier enjoys his new star status, but is increasingly annoyed by unshakable pushy fans. Gringo enjoys Chanel's eagerness to approach the Palerma entourage. After Casper's deceit and incompetence are revealed, Herbert reinstates Jan as coach. Jan reassures Merel for her entrance test, although Amika is unusually restless after M-C sabotages its saddle, but ignores Gringo's camera is on. Olivier enjoys life again with Gringo, preparing a fake video clip shoot for Marie-Claire. Herbert and his wife are furious about Marie-Claire's latest celebrity shenanigans, especially the bodyguards who prevent them entering the canteen to talk to her. She messes up cooking too - she incinerates it. Saskia tries to make Merel, who pretends not to have noticed Tijs, to confront her dad, who has 'finished' an improved 'robot-pony' to simulate horse riding at home. Hedwig doesn't realize yet she's no longer Ollie's flame, until she stumbles upon his draft 'dear John' letters. Olivier and Gringo plan with 'director' David, who will divert MC, how to sneak in Barry Palerma instead of Justin Timberlake, whom MC still awaits absurdly in romantic dreams. And which crazy demands 'Justin' makes. Merle has a nightmare about messing up the English riding school entrance exam. Dad Herbert is furious to read about the concert in the press. To Oli's relieve, Cindy's friend Robbie walks off angry that she puts rehearsals before dating him. Oli quickly arranges a date with Cindy himself. When Robbie apologizes, she dumps him claiming a fellow artists understands her better. The Z Girls have given up photographic proof, hoping they can set up Jan to be caught hot-lipped with Lotte by arranging Merel to pass by for a blind date in the same stable by fake love-letters. Marie-Claire makes the scamps' trick get known so the three bitches cruelly beat the knaves bloody noses. She gives her wardrobe away, hoping daddy will offer her a whole new one now she's been promised a present after Amika going wild. Mathieu Lodewijks is so happy with Jasmin's riding joy that he insists to thank Merel personally, but calling her home betrays to dad she works in the stables, not the mall. Olivier wakes up and discovers ma has once again failed to do or return his laundry, so the rich knave has to walk around in boxer shorts and T-shirt. Still his boyish charm and natural class impress Merel, who has just been hired as Jan's assistant stable hand after 'telling' dad when he could'nt hear. Fiancï¿½e Hedwig's constant domineering is depressing Olivier. Just now he offers to checkout chicks together again, Gringo accepts an invitation to cruise with Casper in his sports car. Em-Ce hires a reputed dance instructor for a stadium choreography, but he soon realizes she isn't talented and dumps her. Herbert finds Merel isn't making enough progress, so part-time trainer Jan is replaced by Casper, full-time, to neither's satisfaction. Tijs still won't have Herbert pay, so he seeks a cheap training method. Elvis's lofty preparations for the casino night continue frantically. Chanel is appointed Z Girls security chief, actually forest look-out, while Hedwig enjoys watching both hunky bodyguards on the monitor. After stealing the elaborate Z girls security plans, Olivier's sharp wit works on, recruiting the rehired stable staff as undercover agents. Team De Ridder contributes Tys's dubious inventions. Olivier arrives last, being released by Cindy, when everyone gathers for the final death wall race. Still Oli is the only one who notices the hidden Z Girls, just in time to convince Chanel not to release the mice to spook the horses. So Marie-Claire looses the race, the casino and the villa. While his dad becomes riding instructor, Oli moves in with the De Ridders as Merel's partner and gets a new, flexible music contract. Riccardo is arrested for multiple fraud cases. Even master manipulator and charmer Olivier sweats when on top of 'fiacï¿½e' Lindsay another date who expects him to marry her, Eline, turns up at home, but manages to prevent them meeting, unknowingly helped by dad. Jan is ordered by Marie-France to find the culprit for the Amika incident by 4, so he fears to loose both the stallion and Merel. She even accepts, against instructions, to coach Jasmin, but Casper takes over again. Gringo convinces Ollie not to miss out on sis's birthday party, as a see of available girls aged sixteen, but the bitch had them both blacklisted and foresaw a bribe attempt, so they can't pass the bouncer and want revenge. Casper finds Jasmin at Amika's shack but fails to notice the stallion. The Z girls continue to prepare Marie-Claire's dream date. Oliver and Gringo are nearly found out in the stables, where airhead Em-Ce takes Ollie's instructions to 'perform' among manure and horse-arses. Marie-Claire's bunch is excited about the video clip, expecting to meet and maybe sing a duet with real superstar Justin Timberlake. Casper get Herbert's approval thanks to Jan's coaching notes, and blackmails Jan to keep silent or he'll tell Tijs about the entrance fee. While breaking in to steal horse fodder, Olivier and Gringo see and film Jan kissing Lotte. Marie-Claire discovers Oli's crush on Merel and mobilizes the EZ Girls to help break them up by bringing Cindy into the picture again trough his manager. Merel scolds Oli for being late, but they end up kissing. Olivier arrived barely in time to see Merel fall and be declared the looser.

Grungo encourages Chanel to snoop for Barry and ma's pa by phoning a French hotel where they may have been together. Now Cindy is clearly into him, Olivier tries to concentrate on their musical cooperation, but his manager insists a showbiz couple siting does wonders for record sales.

Gringo devises a questionnaire for Barry to compare his taste with Chanel's, which fit perfectly. Herbert fires Merel and completely bans her from the stables, even forbids Jan to mention her after vet grandpa Zanders declares Amika saved. Being ignored, Olivier barricades his room, determined to stay home and record a full CD. Uninformed that Merel didn't tell anyone at home that she was fired, Olivier unwittingly spills the beans, but manages to make Tijs believed she should give notice after winning the tournament. For once he's so shy about Merel that Gringo now is encouraging his love-doctor. Their video cheers her up. Oli's mother and sister start on their plan to economize by removing the horses from the stud farm. Far hated Amika is taken to the woods to get lost or starve. But Olivier overhears them and borrows Gringo's bike to inform Merel, just before her bus leaves for the airport. Hedwige treats Olivier to breakfast in his room, but also demands he destroys the sexy DVDs that he hastily pretends to be Gringo's. Poor Gringo is send away again.

Olivier, who was watching a horror movie with buddy Gringo, and his sister get a lecture for disturbing major client Mathieu Lodewijks's reception, but get a last chance to remain unpunished if they set the dinner table and attend on best behavior. After being warned to keep away from Amika by Jan, Merel meets his bratty kid sister Julie. Riccardo accepts Olivier's 20,000 Euro, so Amika is sold, but birdbrain Merel lets the ownership title lie around, so the fiend can burn them and steal the stallion back easily. Meanwhile Cindy claims her price: every second of Oli's attention, yet she lets him pick up wheelchair girl Floor. Warned by Marie-Claire that Merel is on the estate, Tijs arrives just in time to stop Riccardo beating her. Elvis believes neither and locks Amika up. Gringo nearly gives the game away by echoing girls' screams, but Olivier manages to cover for him. Alas, their was no time to install a microphone. Herbert takes his daughter's buyer for Amika seriously, to ma's horror. Meanwhile Tijs goes trough family memories on video as well as his late wife's diary. Casper is heart-broken and furious after Florence 'mysteriously' dumped him. Hedwig asks him for a drive in his sports-car all the way to her Dutch home, having being stood up by her dad. Seeing and fitting the expensive ring he bought, she kisses him. The other Z Girls see this after spying on Jan and his grandpa, the horse-whisperer. They couldn't overhear the discussion about Amika needing fresh air or his lack of appetite may kill the stallion soon. Merel has agreed to help Jan airing Amika early in the morning, but dad Tijs re-sets her alarm clock too late. Olivier's Oxford-prepping misery continues as he's fitted a classical suit, which ominously bursts open. The tailor's fond (failed) rock band memories encourage him to utter singing could be a career, but dad and the baron only insist that means joining a fraternity. Gringo's computer skills prove Barry is the man on Kelly's holiday picture. John William and Jan team up with Merel for the Royal Academy entry test, fixed and paid by the baron, and to restore Amika's strength.

Jan discovers a problem with Amika and calls Herbert, who stops Olivier's dream about Hedwig. Merel is pleasantly surprised by the arrival of aunt Saskia, who moves in and decides to raise the entry fee for the Royal Academy by baking and selling muffins, but Tijs's dough machine fails. Olivier is desperately determined to get on kissing terms with Hedwig, however hesitant she remains and even doubts his sincerity. Because Hedwig and Chanel pretend the reactions on Marie-Claire's YouTube post are great, she lives in a happy bubble. Now Tijs has helped them bake 200 muffins for charity, Merel and Saskia must sell the lot. The laxative does its job, so Cardinero is out of the picture. Herbert however tells his family that not selling is no longer an option they can afford. The kids can now head for the death wall, where their friends are waiting anxiously. Oliver tells Cindy she's not wanted, even the duet has less priority then Merel needing his help. The contenders start the race.

The Amish are an American religious community who eschew modern gadgetry for a nineteenth-century life style. Five of their number take part in an experiment for television. Becky,19,Leah,22,and her 18-year old brother Andrew, Leon who's 18 and 23-year old Jerry come to Britain to spend a week in turn with host families who have children their own age group. First visit is to a South London estate with its host black family. The reported violence is alien to the visitors' peaceful life style and they attend a memorial for a youth killed in a gang fight. They can relate to the choral singing at the hosts' church and visit a mosque,where they show that,despite their youth,they are non-judgmental and can appreciate that there are other religions. For their second week in Britain the Amish visitors stay with a middle-class family in Kent. The boys in the family are members of the group and some of the Amish play instruments,facilitating a jam session. The three Amish boys take to the relaxed life style. Two of them are on 'Rumspringa',a kind of gap year,allowing for more sociable behaviour and Jerry,Leon and Andrew smoke and drink and go swimming with their hosts. Becky,whilst still wearing the long traditional Amish dress, goes paddling. Later their hosts take them to a pop festival where their band is playing. Becky would like to dance and consults the Bible for advice. She is pleased to find that the Bible allows her to dance and she joins in with her new friends. The five Amish youngsters move to Scotland to stay with a wealthy family,in a castle,with a hunting lodge. The life style is such that they have only read about. The family then takes them to their other house in Northamptonshire where the sons show the very willing Amish boys how to play polo. Despite the gap in life styles the host families have been chosen carefully so that they do not judge their guests and indeed strike up immediate friendships with them. The Amish are also liberal and anxious to learn from what they see though they are taken aback by a visit to a fee-paying school attended by one of the English boys where education costs twenty five thousand pounds a term. For their last week in Britain the quintet stay with surfers in Cornwall. The three boys are of course keen to learn how to surf - none of the five had seen the sea before,coming from inland communities - but, surprisingly,so is Becky. Whilst the boys are allowed to strip, the sight of a girl in a figure-hugging wet-suit is,according to the Amish, likely to arouse lustful thoughts in men,so Becky,after a phone call home,dons a floppy T-shirt over her wet-suit to ride the surf.She and Leah also accompany one of the girls,who is getting married,to a bridal shop and put on wedding dresses - something that,at home,would be made,very simply,not shop-bought. The month over, they return to America and discuss their impressions of British life.They have loved the experience though it will never diminish their religious faith. Surprisingly the outward going Leon and Jerry now feel readier to be baptized as Amish,effectively closeting them in their community,whilst the two girls are prepared to see more of life outside their village. One thing is clear. They may be products of their upbringing but their perception and willingness to try new things marks them as anything but square. 1996.

This brand new documentary series sees renowned primatologist Charlotte Uhlenbroek undertake one of the biggest challenges of her career. Over four episodes, Charlotte travels the world on a quest that brings her face to face with some of the world's greatest primates. In Tanzania, observing a troop a baboons (monkeys, no apes) shows in how far they merit their reputation as daredevil pests. They are equally playful, inventive, eager to learn and quarrelsome. Thus they adapt rather well to changes, even man-made. The pecking-order among females is determined by birth, without primogeniture, but reflects on all family members. Males constantly fight for shifting superiority, even wandering over to other troops, but can't win harem-like exclusivity when females are in heat. Chimpanzees are man's closest relatives, 95% DNA-compatible. Their social life is as complex as a human tribe's, with family and political aspects as well as widely differing individual characters. For the troop portrayed in Uganda's forest, that means lots of drama in the power struggle between the unpopular reigning alpha-male and his rivals. In between collecting food, nesting and grooming, they must also contend with a horrible poaching threat. Charlotte's team joins a German zoologist with a ludicrously large local escort to study mountain gorillas in an Uganda forest reserve, demonstrating her ignorance about that environment as well as poor practical planning. The apes prove rather elusive and the jungle weather a terrible spotting-spoilsport. The family of 17 has a rather strict hierarchy where only the youngsters enjoy exemption from the rule of the biggest. The system makes the silver-back their benign despot as well as protector, with two black-back males in waiting, yet the most enterprising one sneakily mates most females too. Nearly all their time is spend eating as their vegetable diet requires an incredible mass of food. The orangutan is highly endangered, having lost nearly all its forests over Asia and rapidly still more to plantations. Conservation will only save it if programs are developed to reintroduce captivity-bred apes to the remaining wild tracts. Such a program in Sabah (northern Malaysian Borneo) shows how complex and hard to learn their lives are, requiring intricate knowledge of the forest, such as edible plants and when they bear fruit, while Charlotte demonstrates her utter ignorance. In 19th century Mexico, Dr. Manuel Fuentes Guerra inherits a fortune of his father, whom never wanted to recognize him as his son. Now turned into a millionaire gentleman, the doctor looks for an appropriate wife. His election falls on Matilde Penalver y Beristain, daughter of an aristocratic family but that has come to less. Manuel, and Matilde's family ignore that she is compromised in secret to a military official by the name of Adolfo Solis. Augusta, the mother of Matilde, has Adolfo put in jail, and Humberto, Matilde's brother, contracts a woman to fake to being Adolfo's in front of Matilde. Now Augusta obligates her daughter to get married to Manuel. Adolfo escapes from jail, but not in time to prevent the wedding. But Matilde discovers the trap that her family had put on her, and suspects that her husband had something to do with it. She decides to abandon him that same day of the wedding, but Manuel discovers her and takes her by the force to his ranch where he subjects her to all types of physical and moral vexations. Adolfo, under another identity, gets to the ranch and is hired by Manuel to be the administrator of Manuel's two ranches, and Manuel gives him all of his confidence. Grudgingly, Matilde has discovered that her husband has many virtues and she finally falls in love with him. The hapiness of Matilde and Manuel shall last very little, especially when the doctor discovers that his administrator is his wife's ex-boyfriend. To Matilde will come the repudiation of her husband, the expulsion from her home, and the public shame because she is pregnant and Manuel doesn't want to recognize his child.

null (Episode 1) A Long Way from Home: 65-year-old Walter Atherton has accepted an offer from his twice-widowed sister, Alice, to emigrate to New Zealand and settle down with her and her 11-year-old son, Joe. Walter has never traveled further than his local pub in Miles Platting, Lancashire, and hasn't seen his sister in 30 years. No wonder things don't immediately fall into place. A Long Way From Home: 65 year old Walter Atherton has accepted an offer from his twice-widowed sister, Alice, to emigrate to New Zealand. There he can settle down with her and her 11 year old son, Joe. Walter has never traveled further than his local pub in Miles Platting, Lancashire, and hasn't seen his sister for 30 years. No wonder things don't immediately fall into place. British transplant Alfie Wickers, is an unorthodox young teacher in the San Diego public school system. Alfie loves his students but his youthful, often naive enthusiasm and unconventional methods put him at odds with his test-obsessed administrators. This was the original "Real World". The show was a weekly documentary which followed the real life travails of the Loud family, a mixed up cluster of suburbanites. The show picked up lots of interesting footage, including an on-camera divorce demand from wife Pat to her husband, and the coming-out of one of the children who was gay. On December 31, 1971, producer Craig Gilbert introduces the audience to the Loud family of Santa Barbara, California: Bill Loud, his wife Pat, and their five children: Lance, Kevin, Grant, Delilah, and Michele. At the Loud home, Pat and the kids prepare for a New Year's Eve party. Bill, recently separated from Pat, has returned from a trip and celebrates with friends at a local club. Craig Gilbert, in voiceover, tells the audience that this is how the story ends. The action shifts back to earlier in the year to show how it begins. In New York, eldest son Lance describes his brothers and sisters. In California, the Louds carry out their daily routines: Pat shops at the market, Bill views a demolition, Delilah attends dance school, Michele tends to her horse, and Grant practices with his garage band. Lance phones the family from New York, and Pat grows weary of his telephone antics. September 13, 1971. Delilah and a bored, sleepy Grant register for their high school classes. Bill spends the morning shopping for his new bachelor pad. The kids complain about their first day of school. Kevin returns from Southeast Asia and notes Grant's weird behavior. At school, Kevin and his classmates plan a creative assembly to launch the new school year. Grant and his band practice their part of the school extravaganza, in which Grant plays the lead singer of the fictional band Warlock, and is chased by a mob of crazed fans. At the end of the day, the family relaxes in the pool. Pat and Bill are at odds over Lance, who needs help getting back to the States. In Europe, Lance and Kristian encourage their friend Judy to call her mom and beg for money. October 1971. Grant and his friend get stoned and receive a phone call from Lance who says he's amassed a fortune in Hawaiian shirts and a 50 page letter from Bill. Later, Lance boards a flight to Santa Barbara. The family collects Lance from the airport, where he makes a dramatic final exit from the plane. Back at the Loud home, Lance shows off his shirts, and he and Delilah try on makeup together. The kids celebrate Pat's 45th birthday. Lance annoys Pat while she's cleaning the pool. Bill discusses new furniture for his apartment. Lance rides his bike to Bill's office, while Bill, in voiceover narration, reads a portion of his touching letter to Lance. Bill arrives at his office, and he and Lance discuss the divorce. Kevin visits the office, too, and snaps a photo of Bill and Lance. In the series conclusion, Pat watches Grant and his band audition at a local club. Delilah visits Bill, who sends her back to Pat with a new outfit he bought for her. Pat models the ensemble and makes a sarcastic comment about Bill still not having a clue about her style. Bill and his accountant arrange Pat's divorce settlement. Lance and Kristian make a home movie on the beach with another friend. At the Loud home, Pat convenes a family meeting and orders the kids to keep up with their household chores and stay out of her liquor cabinet. Later, she confronts Lance about his lifestyle. Lance insists he's doomed but says he can laugh about the inevitability of his failure. Bill and a friend discuss how the American family has been sold a bad bill of goods about what's expected of them. Pat dines with friends and contemplates her future as a divorcï¿½e. Memorial Day weekend, 1971, Pat takes a room at the Chelsea in New York for a visit with Lance. She meets Lance's roommate Soren Ingenue, fellow resident Holly Woodlawn, and their colorful coterie of Manhattan friends. Lance and Soren escort Pat to Vain Victory, a transvestite musical, but when the scene grows tense, Soren gets them tickets to No, No Nanette, a musical more in line with Pat's tastes. Lance and Pat take a stroll through Central Park, discussing Lance's childhood and his unsatisfying relationship with Bill. Later, they visit a fortune teller who foretells enormous change in Pat's life by October. Before returning home, Pat lectures Lance about being more responsible. Pat stops in Baltimore on the way home from visiting Lance and takes care of some business for Bill. Back in Santa Barbara, the kids fool around in the yard, and Delilah slips off with boyfriend Brad to kiss. Bill meets Pat at the airport. They go to lunch and discuss Lance's bizarre life in New York City. Bill grouses about his sons being lazy, prompting Pat to defend them. Later, at a dinner party, Bill ignores Pat's opinions about a union strike that's affecting his business. Pat helps Delilah prepare for a dance recital, where Delilah gives a solo performance. June 1971. Lance reveals to the family that he has a new apartment without Soren. He's planning a trip to Europe with a theater group. Pat flies to her hometown of Eugene, Oregon to celebrate her mother's birthday. Pat and Grandma Russell drive around Eugene, visiting many important landmarks from Pat's past. Pat laments all the changes and how things "get fouled up". Through old photographs, home movies, and narration, Pat wistfully recalls her late father and a happy childhood in South America with elder brother Tom. Grandma Russell enjoys a birthday party with her friends. Later, she and Pat share a low-key lunch before Pat returns to California. July 1971 is a time of departures for the Loud family. Pat, Delilah, Michelle, and Delilah's friend Suzanne Tate leave on a road trip to an artists' colony in Taos, New Mexico. Meanwhile, Bill is sending Kevin off to Southeast Asia to tour mines with a business colleague. With most of the kids out of the way, Bill schemes to have Grant work a summer job with nephew David, who owns a concrete extruding business. Lance phones to say that he's leaving for six weeks in Europe with the theater group Pedestrian. Grant sarcastically thanks everyone for the concrete caper when he's badgered into accepting David's job. Bored with Taos, Delilah and Suzanne take a Greyhound bus back to California, leaving a miserable Michele behind with drunken adults. Delilah wonders what's going on when she phones home, is told she can't return to the Loud house, and Bill refuses to reveal his whereabouts. It's late July 1971, and Pat has returned from New Mexico. Over a lunch of scotch and martinis, Bill and Pat express antithetical attitudes regarding their children. Pat's afraid of losing them, while Bill can't wait for them to leave home. Pat is abandoned by Delilah and loses a skirmish with a disobedient Michele. The scene shifts to August. Bill returns from another business trip to find that raging brush fires have come close to destroying the Loud home. Pat and Bill engage in a petty domestic spat. Kevin calls from Southeast Asia to talk about his trip. In Paris, Lance and his friend Kristian Hoffman meet some bizarre characters and lament their desperate need for more money. After another quarrel between her parents, an embarrassed Delilah confides to Brad that she'll live with a man before committing to marriage. At the Santa Barbara fiesta, Bill flirts outrageously with other women, while a wounded Pat assaults him with trenchant comments. Later, the two lounge carefree by the pool and play "good cop, bad cop" with Grant over his music career. Working in the hot Santa Ana sun, David's crew teases Grant. After work, everyone goes to David's apartment, where they discuss Grant's involvement in a car accident. Fearing Big Bill's reaction to the wrecked Volvo, Grant gets drunk on vodka screwdrivers. The next day he drives back to Santa Barbara, worried about the scene he'll face at home, but Pat proves very loving and sympathetic to his plight. While Bill takes an extended business trip through the southern and Midwestern United States, Pat meets with an attorney to instigate divorce proceedings. Later, she drives to her brother Tom's home in Glendale. Tom and wife Yvonne listen to Pat's interpretation of her disintegrating marriage, including Bill's extramarital affairs and his tenuous relationship with Lance. On the road, Bill describes to business associates the more lighthearted aspects of his family. Back in Santa Barbara, Pat has surrounded herself with the kids and their friends. Grant goes to the airport to pick up Bill, who jokes about walking into the lion's den at home, unaware of the drama about to unfold. A nervous Grant drives Bill home from the airport. When they arrive, Pat ambushes Bill with news that she's divorcing him and wants him to leave their home immediately. Pat stares out a bedroom window and the family is subdued as Bill packs his bags, arranges a hotel room, and drives off into the night. The next day, a listless Pat lies by the pool listening to a melancholy song by Carole King. Later, she watches wistfully as Michele and Delilah perform a dance routine and piano duet. Bill calls the house to check on things, and Pat treats him with indifference. Grant lightens the mood by playing Apeman and Mother Nature's Son for Pat and his sisters. Cicily prepares for a semester abroad in Nigeria while Bill and Karen contend with conflicting reactions to her imminent departure. Bill is excited about his daughter's visit to the homeland, while Karen worries about her safety. After severe hemorrhaging, Karen is hospitalized and copes with the prospect of a hysterectomy if experimental drugs fail to solve her problem. Bill flies to Ohio for a performance that doesn't go well. Back in Queens, Cicily's first phone call comes in from Africa. Bill and Karen are continuously confronted with changes in their quickly growing children. Cicily returns to Colgate University for her final year. Chaney, at the young age of 12, has found her first boyfriend and wants to date - an issue over which Bill and Karen are at odds. Bill's impulse is to protect his "baby" from boys, while Karen is swept up in Chaney's girlish excitement. Cicily's semester abroad in Nigeria spotlights her continuing struggle with racial identity and social loyalties. To her disappointment, this emerges as the central theme of her trip to Africa. She is stuck in the middle between black classmates who criticize her friendships with whites and whites who are offended by their black classmates ignoring them and resenting their presence on the trip. The blacks are further angered by second-class treatment from their African hosts. Cicily finds comfort in her first love, a young Nigerian man who is taunted by his friends for being with a "white" woman. A more mature Cicily, with a new Afro-centric sensibility, returns to New York. She becomes increasingly withdrawn, sensing that her parents don't fully comprehend her feelings and experiences. But family discord dissolves when it's discovered that Cicily has malaria. As Christmas approaches, Bill's parents arrive from Ohio for the holidays. Cicily is home from the hospital by New Year's Eve and family and friends celebrate together. Cicily is shocked by the responsibilities of adult life. She returns home from school to find that Chaney has taken over the room they once shared, her college loans must soon be paid and she has to find a job. Bill and Cicily, at home together after four years apart, continuously get on each other's nerves. Bill, discouraged by his flagging career, drinks more and more. Karen takes the girls away for a weekend at the beach and bolsters Cicily's self esteem. Bill contends with his music career and resolves to give up drinking. Cicily eventually lands a job. Bill returns to his hometown, Marion, Ohio, after Alton, his son from a former relationship, is arrested on drug charges. Bill was a teenager when he fathered his first children and he grapples with guilt about the son and daughter he left behind. He revisits the streets of his childhood in a now-disintegrated black community, noting "there is no more black culture." Many of his family and old friends now either work at the nearby prison or have served time there - a fate Bill narrowly escaped and one from which he was unable to save his son. Cicily's graduation is just weeks away and Karen is determined to attend. She decides to abandon her drug therapy and have a hysterectomy - a decision that prompts anxiety, insecurity and sadness about her inability to have more children, as well as her future as a woman and a wife. Bill nurses Karen back to health and also cares for Chaney. The family proudly honors Cicily, the first college graduate from either side of the family. Bill accompanies Karen to her 25th high school reunion, a journey fraught with anxiety for both of them. For the first time in years, they confront many of the people who ostracized and tormented them when their relationship began. The trip back to Ohio prompts much thought and discussion about the past and the joyful and painful events that led to Cicily's birth, which cemented their relationship for life. As they visit Karen's father's grave, they are steadfastly resolved that "the two of us will be together 'til the day we die." Against the backdrop of the girls' surprise anniversary dinner for their parents, Karen and Bill reflect on the early, difficult years of their relationship, which began in 1967 when they met at Indian Lake in Ohio and became friends. Their subsequent love affair unleashed a firestorm of community outrage. The family ventures to upstate New York to pick up Cicily at Colgate University, where she's struggling with relationships with fellow students - black and white. Back at school, Cicily finds herself further ostracized by the black community on campus, but after her experience in Africa she feels less able to relate to her white classmates. She struggles to understand who she is and to find her place in a world defined by categories that don't include her. Karen travels alone to Florida for a visit with her mother in an all-white neighborhood. Karen realizes that the decisions each of them has made in marriage (her mother remarried after the death of Karen's father) have taken them into separate worlds. The story is set in an alernate 1970's, on an Earth where Germany won WWII and has occupied England. Peter Ingram is a writer on a popular soap opera (also titled "An Englishman's Castle) that is set in London during the Blitz. Ingram lives a quiet, boring life, deliberately oblivious to the subtle rule of the local Nazis. His eyes are opened when the woman he is involved with reveals that she is both a Jew and a member of the Underground. Will Peter help overthrow his countries oppressors?
null Brit 'Karl Pilkington' (qv) has led a sheltered life. Not having done any traveling, he enjoys living within the comforts of what he knows, basically that being what is purely British. As such, his friends, 'Ricky Gervais' (qv) and 'Stephen Merchant' (qv), decide to send Karl to various parts of the world to experience unfamiliar cultures. Stephen believes that travel is a life broadening venture, and hopes that Karl will indeed feel like his life is enriched by these travels. Ricky, however, hopes that Karl will hate every minute of his travels. For Ricky, this experiment is the most expensive gag for his own pleasure that he could have conceived. When Karl is told that his next trip will be to Rio de Janeiro to see Christ the Redeemer atop Corcovado, his first reaction is that it is akin to a pylon: something that is there everyday that people probably get tired of seeing. What Ricky and Stephen don't tell him until he arrives in Rio is that they want him to be more social on his trips. As such, they place him in a dorm room in a hostel. They do tell him that Carnival will be happening while he's there. He's not too excited about it as he hates crowds and he presupposes it's a gay event, which makes him feel uncomfortable. But he is thrown into the festivities, whether he likes it or not. His anxiety at crowds is heightened when he is told he is also to attend a block party. He remarks at the dichotomy between the Catholic nature of the statue towering over the city, versus the overt sexuality displayed by the people, especially at the beach. His discomfort increases with interactions with his guide, Celso, which includes excursions to make sure Karl looks his best at the beach, a stop at the particular section of beach, and an invitation to stay the night at his place. And much like his sights were overwhelmed in India, his sense of hearing is overwhelmed throughout his stay in the city. He searches for a sanctuary, which doesn't end up being what he expects. When he finally goes to see Christ the Redeemer, will he still liken it to a pylon? He is given a slightly different perspective when he is taken on a helicopter ride around the monument. Ricky and Stephen send Karl on his first trip to perhaps Karl's worst nightmare: China. The reason that Karl is so afraid of this locale is that what he is exposed to of Chinese culture - that being solely his local Chinatown - he does not understand at all, and he is afraid that if he gets a taste for some exotic Chinese food, such as toad, he won't be able to find it when he gets back home. On his itinerary is Beijing, the Great Wall of China (which he ends up believing is not great but a sham), and Shanhaiguan. Stephen also surprises him with some excursions, namely to a fortune teller (the thoughts from who Karl takes to heart despite not wanting to experience it since he does not want to know bad news in advance), on an extended trip to lesser section of the Great Wall, to a kung fu school where he is not only a spectator but also a student, and for a traditional hot massage, which is a little hotter than he would like. Karl has perhaps the most issue with the public restrooms, where there are no doors on the toilet stalls, and the food. Although he can avoid the street food which is unusual to him, he can't avoid the meal prepared for him on his remote visit to the Great Wall. Ricky and Stephen figure that if Karl won't climb Mount Everest, a good manageable substitute for him would be to climb Mount Fuji. Starting in Tokyo, Karl first visits a cat cafï¿½, where for ï¿½15, he gets the luxury of petting cats while drinking his beverage. This relaxing but somewhat benign activity for Karl is contrasted by his next experience, partaking in the activity of sumo wrestling. Karl just hopes he will not be pinned under a fat arse while doing it. His first night in Tokyo is spent in cozy quarters, but it is the associated noise that bothers him. To get him refreshed after this night's sleep, Stephen and Ricky arrange for him to exercise, Japanese work styled. Karl's impression of Japan before arriving was high tech, and he does eventually see high tech items around in his travels, the experience of which he wants to utilize fully to show the viewing audience something useful in terms of an invention of his creation, regardless of Ricky and Stephen's wants. Ricky and Stephen send him back to ancient traditions to sample what was the forerunner to modern sushi. After that experience, they send him to visit with a zen Buddhist monk to relax, but the ritual he goes through is not what Karl would consider relaxing. Ricky and Stephen want to give Karl an idea of how mammoth an undertaking the climb will be by giving him an interesting vista of the mountain before the actual climb. Although that vista doesn't give Karl the view he had hoped, the actual climb does give him some perspective, and some inspiration for that much wanted invention. Compiled from what they consider universally standard lists, Ricky and Stephen provide Karl with a 100 item bucket list from which he can choose a handful for his next travel adventures. Karl has no desire to do anything he considers dangerous or stupid such as bungee jumping, and the list in general is comprised of things he wouldn't normally choose, but he does choose one night on a deserted island as his first bucket list travel adventure. Ricky and Stephen find a deserted island in Vanuatu in the South Pacific for him, but they figure he may as well have some adventures while he's traveling to get there. First stop: bungee jumping in New Zealand! They also send him to do such South Pacific activities as land diving and arseboarding. He also spends a night with a native tribe that worships 'Prince Philip' (qv). He finally makes it to a tribe that is one step away from his ultimate destination, they who provide him with his "Man Friday" who will help him with some basics before he leaves the island, as well as some typical clothing of the area. But Ricky makes sure that Karl isn't totally alone on his one night on what Karl calls his muffin island. For Karl's trip to Egypt, Ricky and Stephen believe it's time for him to experience budget travel by flying economy and staying in the seediest of hotels, about which Karl is not too happy. Karl's first experiences wandering the streets of Cairo makes him wonder how anyone gets anything done, as he is bombarded by street hawkers at every turn. Unlike his other travels, Karl ends up traveling almost immediately via camel-back to see the main site, the Great Pyramids, due to their close proximity, which ends up being underwhelming if only because of the weather. As he waits for the weather to clear to make another attempt to see the Pyramids, Karl is provided a guide, Achmed, who gives him a lesson in bartering, and takes him to the Museum of Egyptian Antiquities, in which Karl has no interest. So Karl ditches his guide to find some comfort food, which ends up also being an experience to which he is unaccustomed. Stephen and Ricky then send him on a Nile cruise, which does not lift his spirits beyond doing something just to piss off Ricky. They also send him to visit a couple named Andrew and Seija, who provide an alternative view of the Pyramids. Karl then revisits the Pyramids, which he will not believe great if only because they're old (unless they are the oldest things on Earth). Upon Karl's arrival in Delhi, his senses are overwhelmed, and not in a good way, which is not helped by his sleeping arrangements. He trusts on day two of his trip, he will feel better if only because things can't get worse. He is scheduled for an eight hour overnight bus ride to the Kumbh Mela Festival, the largest religious festival in the world, which he is not looking forward to since he is not a religious person and doesn't understand the attraction of religion. But the day ends up being a "colorful" one in an unexpected way, which in part is the reason for him not feeling too well. As if the festival was not enough, his next stop is to visit with a living saint in his ashram for some spiritual guidance. Next, he is sent to a cow sanctuary, where he comes up close and personal with many aspects of the sacred animal, including its famous patties. And finally, he goes to Agra to visit the Taj Mahal, which he believes was built out of guilt. Karl is somewhat excited about his trip to Petra, Jordan, if only because of its association with the movie _Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989)_ (qv), although he does mention that he would rather live in a cave across from the palace rather than live in the palace to be able to see the beautiful instead of seeing the squalor from the beautiful. His excitement is tempered when Stephen and Ricky suggest that since he is in the Middle East, that he take advantage of the situation by visiting Israel as well. This suggestion scares him because all news stories out of Israel are generally grim. Karl is amazed by the dichotomy of religion, which should be peaceful, versus the presence of armed military everywhere. Ricky and Stephen further surprise him with some training apropos to being in a war torn region of the world. Crossing the border into Bethlehem, which is in the Palestinian side, strengthens that dichotomy in his mind. On his way to Jordan, Karl stops off at the Dead Sea, which he sees as somewhat of a refuge for himself. The enjoyment he experiences floating in the water is marred by a telephone call from his friends, and something else floating in the water. Once in Jordan, Ricky and Stephen have arranged for him a two day camel ride across the desert to get to Petra, instead of the faster drive. Once in Petra, which is all Karl really wanted to see on this trip, Ricky and Stephen further surprise him by fulfilling his stated wish. Karl in turn surprises Ricky and Stephen by his response after that experience. Karl, now back in Britain after his "seven wonders" trips, sits down with Ricky and Stephen to discuss the experience. Stephen is confused by Karl's seemingly contradictory statements about not wanting to miss the many sights and sounds on his travels, but also being overly annoyed by them. Many of those sights center on food. Many of the situations Karl experienced he classifies as false fun, which he does not like in principle. They talk about the people Karl met. Karl tells them about what he thinks he's learned from these travels. They discuss the fact that many viewers believe Karl is an actor playing a buffoon and that the show is scripted, or that Stephen and especially Ricky are bullies to Karl. Stephen and Ricky talk about their favorite moment: the Israeli terrorist training, which Karl did not know was going to occur. Beyond that situation, Karl talks about what was perhaps his most difficult experience. Despite Karl's assertions that he won't do another, they talk concepts for a second series. Karl gives his thoughts on his general impression of the world. And he compares these recent travels to his favorite travels, those when he was a child to a holiday park in Wales, those travels which he recently recreated. Karl Pilkington finally returns home after travelling around the world to see the Seven Wonders of the World. Back in Britain he's quizzed about his travels abroad by his friends Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant, who want to find out if he's actually learned anything from his experiences. Ricky's suggestion of the next bucket list item to do - meeting the endangered mountain gorilla in its natural habitat - does impress Karl, if only because of their likeness to humans (Ricky states they are 98% genetically identical to humans). Although the gorillas Karl will meet are located in Uganda, Stephen and Ricky think Karl should see other parts of the sub-Saharan African continent while he's there anyway. They first send him to South Africa to help with a charity advising local children and rebuilding huts, which ends up unnerving him primarily because he requires a security guard on his stay. While Karl's there, Stephen and Ricky encourage him to partake in an activity which he didn't do on a previous trip. Karl then drives to a residence, the owners who have a hippo as a pet that has access to the inside of the house. Next, he visits with the Ndebele tribe, where he will learn their painting techniques, while he cooks a meal for their king. He is next sent to take part is a major wildlife conservation project where a wild male rhino is being relocated for the survival of the local females. Finally arriving in Uganda, Karl is first tasked with purchasing second-hand clothes to wear for his gorilla meeting, the actual meeting which is not quite as Karl expects, but which he still takes away profound realizations of life. Karl isn't overly concerned about going to Mexico beyond Ricky and Stephen's assertion that it probably is the most dangerous place from a personal safety perspective than anywhere he's traveled thus far. As he travels there during the Easter season, Karl is exposed to two religious celebrations, the first which recreates the crucifixion and resurrection of Christ, and the second which is on the surface less religious and which the authorities would like to shut down if only because of its explosive and thus potentially dangerous nature. Interspersed between these two, Stephen and Ricky send Karl into training for what has become a Mexican cultural phenomenon: professional wrestling. He makes two stops on his way to the raison d'etre for the trip to Mexico, Chichï¿½n Itzï¿½: the first to experience the life of a churro (a Mexican cowboy), and the second to spend some time with a Mayan family who are descendants of the builders of Chichï¿½n Itzï¿½. The latter stop exposes him to more unusual food, namely bee larvae. He finally arrives at Chichï¿½n Itzï¿½ before dawn to beat the crowds, and to watch the sunrise over the monument. However, Karl can only focus on the issue of the "dead heads" associated with the place. Throughout his stay in Mexico, Karl goes on a search for the Mexico of his childhood, and it is uncertain if he will be able to find it. And he makes a surprising admission before he heads home. Karl is relieved that this trip is his last, but is worried that Ricky and Stephen will do something monumentally outrageous to end the series on a high note. Karl has never heard of the monument he is to visit next: Machu Picchu. He is also not aware of the potential of altitude sickness due to lack of oxygen. But he is not concerned about the eleven hour trek to get to Machu Picchu, as he likes camping, and even makes preparations for a makeshift toilet. When he gets to his Peruvian lakeside location to start his trek, he learns that Ricky and Stephen are making him trek through the jungle along the Amazon instead. Of his Amazon accommodations, Karl is unsure of what's worse: the first couple of nights staying deep in the jungle in a tent among all the nocturnal creatures, many which are deadly, or the last few nights staying with a native tribe who used to be cannibals. When he reaches his destination of Machu Picchu, where he does feel the effects of lack of oxygen, Karl makes a surprise announcement to Ricky and Stephen. They in turn talk to him about a potential second season of the series. Will Karl agree to such? Karl isn't overly excited by his next trip, it to drive along Route 66, as he believes its general public mystique may be something manufactured by excitable Americans. He will drive the route west to east, starting in Santa Monica, California, but not in the type of convertible he was hoping. His first arranged stop he doesn't think will be a memorable one, but it ends up being memorable as what he considers one of the most embarrassing situations ever in his life. Two of the next three stops will show Karl that many man-made curiosities have popped up along the route. Those somewhat benign stops sandwich what ends up being an uncomfortable one, where, in a traditional hippie section of the route, he participates in cuddle therapy. Next, in a section of the route where the gold rush occurred, he meets with a modern day prospector, who has a few explosive off-road surprises for him. He trades up his vehicle at the next stop for a truck named "Nasty Boy" by its owner. He takes a 180 degree turn culturally when he lives the Amish way in Indiana. Feeling like Karl may be bored of driving, Stephen and Ricky arrange for Karl to see the last part of the route by air, from which he ends up having an interesting vantage point. They may ultimately have to resort to Plan B to finish the trip, depending on what is the lesser of two evils for Karl. Karl travels to Australia to swim with dolphins, but the trip doesn't turn out as expected. On the way, he stops in Thailand, where he meets some ladyboys and gets attacked by monkeys. In Australia, he swims with sharks instead of dolphins. Still in India, Karl and Warwick are still clashing over Karl's want to be part of the Spider Sister's "act", as Warwick feels it's solely to capitalize on his dwarfism and the old mentality of him and the Spider Sisters being sideshow freaks. Once in China and on a Yangtze River cruise, Warwick believes that Karl's experience on the cruise is some retribution. They next travel to a panda reserve, and are required to get up and close and personal with one in what Karl considers a less than safe way. They decide to do some people watching on a down Sunday in Chengdu, with them being the ones watched at a food fair. This experience demonstrates how far Karl has progressed in what he is willing to do as a regular tourist. They next plan to scale Mount Emeishan to visit a Buddhist temple atop. This experience shows to the other how much they have relied on the other on this trip. They finally reach what is supposed to be their final destination of Hong Kong. Ricky, however, wants to provide them with what they think is a special side trip to Macau, but what is meant for their adventures to end on a high. Karl and Warwick arrive in Mumbai, India, the country which Karl hated on his last visit. Warwick, who is immediately taken by the sights and sounds, hopes Karl will appreciate it this second time around, while Karl wants to expose Warwick to the down and dirty side of life in India. They partake in the morning activity of laughing yoga. Ricky manages to get both Warwick and Karl parts in a Bollywood movie, which is right up Warwick's alley, but in which Karl wants to do his own improvisation. Next, Ricky gets them on a train to Varanasi, specifically so that they can watch the sun rise over the Ganges after they camp overnight by the riverside. That once in a lifetime activity is jeopardized specifically by Karl's reaction to some neighbors and on the sun in general. It is the life and death daily activity that fascinates both Karl and Warwick. They hop back on a train to head to West Bengal for the next activity chosen by Warwick, performing in the Olympic Circus, which is challenging if only in choosing what they will do that will impress the crowds. It's what Karl chooses next to see that could threaten his friendship with Warwick. For the latest proposed travel adventure of Marco Polo's route from Venice to China, Karl wants to take along a mate for support and companionship. Who Ricky assigns is 'Warwick Davis (I)' (qv), who Karl believes will be more of a hindrance than an asset if only because of his dwarf stature. But as their stay in their first locale - Venice - progresses, Karl realizes that the biggest problem with Warwick as an adventure travel partner is their total incompatibility in terms of what they want to do and experience. Their first Warwick chosen event is to attend a masquerade ball, which is a ritual of the area dating back centuries. Their choice of costumes reflects what they want to portray of themselves, although Karl feels less inclined to partake in the masquerade portion of the costume selection. This Warwick chosen activity is balanced by a Karl chosen activity: using a jet pack to fly over the canals. This activity ends up being a little less fun than Karl had anticipated. They then take a short cut from Marco Polo's route to go to Macedonia, first to hang out with Romani gypsies. Then on Warwick's suggestion for both their enjoyment, they go to see practitioners of Sufi Islam, they who perform mystical exercises. Karl is surprised that he himself enjoys participating in the ritual of the exercises, until... Finally, on Ricky's want, Karl goes up in the air attached to over-sized helium balloons. But Karl figures what is good for the goose is also good for the gander, which doesn't sit well with either Ricky or Warwick, if only for Karl's rationale. The next adventure that Ricky and Steven convince Karl to do is take a trip on the Trans-Siberian Express, which is the least offensive of the bucket list items but which is still not very palatable to him. He dreads the train trip more after his encounter with one of the first people he meets in Moscow. His pre-train trip stay in Moscow is not helped by his encounter with a roomful of half naked men. But once on the train he begins to relax... for twenty minutes. At his first stop, he, in honor of the 50th anniversary of 'Yuri Gagarin' (qv)'s space flight, is to go into cosmonaut training. He is relieved by some news with this regard. Back on the train, he meets a man, whose gift he finds somewhat silly but still cannot be fascinated by. At the next stop, he learns about a natural healing process, which may be literally his most death defying feat yet, but one in which he ultimately feels very relaxing. He learns that he will take a side trip into Mongolia, where he must defend the honor of the family with who he will be staying. He dislikes the actual activity as much as the way he looks doing it. And he learns that the trip will end in a place to which he is not looking forward, but one where he may receive some redemption. Karl sets off to Alaska to go on a whale-watching cruise. Before heading out to sea, he journeys across a frozen landscape on foot, by snowmobile, and by dog sled. The cruise aboard a working deep-sea fishing boat proves difficult for Karl. This show is about people of varying vocations that discuss not only what they do, but the different challenges they've met along the way. Everyone has a story to share and how their challenges not only changed their perspective, but what they've done to spread their own light and voice to help others.

Recently, I watched the movie Mission: Impossible II for the first time. And guess what? I found a scene that was both unintentionally awkward and a moment. So I figured, hey, this is an unintentionally awkward moment! Actually, this is more random than awkward, but, you get the idea.

However Cordelia,attracted to Andrew,finds that Julia is also having an affair with employee Peter Forbes,who is found murdered. Julia is arrested but Cordelia discovers that Andrew's philanderings go beyond dalliances with employees and uncovers a family secret that leads to the real killer's identity.

Following an anonymous tip-off from another police officer,Cordelia learns that Bolton's father was a policeman with Fergusson but, after a bungled job in which Bolton took the blame and Fergusson the glory, he committed suicide. Is Fergusson being black-mailed? Or is the distraught wife with whom he was having the affair out for revenge? Or maybe Laura is not as innocent as she seems. The documentaries portray the diverse forms of life along the coastlines of the various North Sea states and the changes that these are subject to, whether it be the effects of climate change on the quality of seawater, the animal kingdom and coastal formations, the consequence of young people migrating from the coast to cities, the increase in tourism accompanied by new hotel complexes, or even the effects of unemployment. Each film marks a stage of a journey along the different coastlines and dwells on central questions such as: have the changes that have occurred in coastal regions over recent decades completely altered people's attitudes towards life? Is there perhaps such a thing as a convectional North Sea identity? Or do the inhabitants of the individual North Sea states prefer to dissociate themselves from one another?
