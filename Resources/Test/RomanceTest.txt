The program shows that "The Arab Spring" was PL: less a political event than it was about the coming of the industrial PL: revolution to a region where over 90% of the population lives and works PL: outside the rule of law. De Soto shows us that this informal economy is, PL: however, the one common thread that can contribute to the region's growth PL: and stability.

It was not the $225 lost from his fruit cart, PL: expropriated by the police, that transformed young Bouazizi into a martyr PL: and a symbol of the revolution - it was his similarity to the 180 million PL: informal Arab entrepreneurs; many of them under 30 and computer literate.

Traveling through the PL: region, De Soto summarizes, "Throughout the Middle East the story is the PL: same.

The Arab consensus ahead is about more than emancipating the PL: entrepreneurial spirit; it's about resolving the institutional deficiencies PL: that make most Arabs desperately poor."
