 MV: Overdose: Death of a Punk Rocker (2014)  PL: Join Brian as he tries to prove that his former best friend and punk rock PL: band-mate's death was anything but an accident. Filled with humor, social PL: commentary, and mystery, its script has been called "brave", PL: "entertaining", "hilarious", and "destined to become a cult classic". In PL: Overdose: Death of a Punk Rocker, we are introduced to Brian: former bass PL: player/song writer for the now famous punk rock band, "The B-movie PL: Nightmares". He currently sells guitar strings at Mr. G's guitar store in PL: Houston, Texas. Even though he missed his big break, Brian keeps a positive PL: outlook. Plus, it was his choice to leave the band, even though he and Brad PL: were at one point the best of friends. It's all because Brad let Snarf into PL: the band. Snarf is a tall, skinny, crazy junkie. There are no limits to the PL: lows he'll go through for the latest buzz. His shenanigans to make Brian PL: understand his addictions seem never-ending. One shenanigan in particular PL: leads to Brian's exodus from the band. Brian was so upset that he said they PL: could keep playing his songs. He didn't care one bit. But he never thought PL: they'd blow up and sell 3 million copies of an album of his songs. Then the PL: news came on TV and said Brad was dead. A heroin overdose they said. It all PL: seemed so clich�d. Brian didn't believe it. He was going to figure out what PL: really happened. His "investigation" leads him to Marley, Brad's former PL: drug dealer. Brian ends up revealing the B-movie Nightmare's back-story as PL: well as his own through his conversations with Marley. Was it a simple PL: overdose or was there foul play? And if it was foul play, then who's to PL: blame? Was it Snarf? What about the Korean Cowboy? A Satanic Ronald Reagan? PL: Brian asks "just one more thing" [ala Columbo] in his quest to seek out the PL: truth...But no one said it'd be just another leisurely Sunday murder PL: mystery. And it certainly won't be as polite.  BY: Yarotsky, D.J.
