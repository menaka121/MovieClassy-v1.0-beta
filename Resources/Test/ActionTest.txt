PL: The younger fighters want to beat him, and so the question of scoring that PL: once-a-year championship bout against Jackson Lee looms large in the minds PL: of these very ambitious, competitive killers. Many of the Circle of Honor PL: fighters are professional hit met, assassins, soldiers of fortune, military PL: men and women, while some are dentists and accountants. They all lead PL: double lives because there is absolutely nothing legal about the Circle of PL: Honor.  BY: Anonymous
