The dead man  also happens to be someone Holden had an altercation with in a club the  night before; he denies to the police however that he knew or had even seen  the man. DI Peter Carlisle is assigned to the case and Holden's attempts at  bullying him - including a complaint to Holden's pal the DCI - have little  impact. The autopsy reveals that the man had been dead for some hours and  his body moved to the arcade after his death but Carlisle insists that the  just opened arcade remain closed.    DI Carlisle continues his investigation and learns from the dead man's  friends that he had left them after their bout of drinking to find a  prostitute. He interviews several of the local working girls and although  they deny ever having seen him, the police get an anonymous tip that he was  seen heading toward the flats where they work.

Ripley's son Danny is called in  for a police interview about the murder. Daughter Shyanne meanwhile visits  her ex-boyfriend and learns that it was her father who scared him off.    The forensic evidence indicates that Mike Hooley was killed with a blow to  the head but also places him in Ripley Holden's flats before he was moved  to the arcade. DI Carlisle tells him that he knows they had an argument in  the club but Holden blows him off. He also has other problems on his mind,  specifically that he owes 80 grand to the Inland Revenue and has no choice  but to mortgage the arcade to raise the funds. Natalie and Carlisle  continue their affair but he still hasn't told her he's a copper. Shyanne  visits Steve who tells her that he was terrified of her father when they  were at school together. They spend the day in bed but after he says  goodbye to her at a bus stop, he is badly beaten. Shyanne is convinced it's  her father's doing.

Danny, fed up at being a failure at everything  he touches, decides to do something about it.    Having confessed to DI Carlisle that he moved Poole's body to the arcade,  Natalie spontaneously provides him with an alibi telling the police that  she had picked him up soon after he was dropped off at the flats. Natalie  believes Ripley is hiding something from her however. It's obvious Carlisle  is determined to get Ripley at any cost and his partner suggests to him  that he may not be acting ethically. Carlisle decides he's right and takes  himself off the case. He pursues Natalie and asks her to leave Blackpool  with him.

null   Before CNN, cam-corders, and communications satellites, the only way to  view exotic locales was on real film that might take weeks or months to  arrive from the far corners of the world. The raison d'etre for this  program was to bring that film to the television viewer. Each week some  adventurer would be asked to narrate his 16 mm home movies for the viewing  audience. The film might be from the Amazon jungle or the arctic regions of  northern Alaska. Teenage boys were drawn to the show not only by the  adventure but also by the occasional fleeting glimpse of some native  woman's bare breast.

Two teams, which consist of students from the Universal Technical Institute  in Phoenix, Ariz. will compete during an eight-week challenge to build a  drag car to race in the series finale. The winning team will earn  scholarships and cash prizes and the losing car gets crushed.    "Burt Luddin's Love Buffet" was a short-lived rehash of "The Newlywed  Game," which attempted to marry the rules from that often-imitated game  show with situation comedy elements; the game took place in a Las  Vegas-style setting. During the game element, host Luddin asked the couples  questions about their love lives and relationships, with correct matches  worth points. The couple with the most points after three rounds played a  bonus round. In the bonus round, the partners were seated on opposite sides  of a wall (inside a cubicle shaped like a heart). Luddin asked 10 questions  about each partner's behavior (usually off-beat or bizzare, such as "makes  animal sounds in their sleep"); each player held up a pair of underwear  boxers for men, panties for the women to answer which one fits that  particular behavior. Each match was worth cash, with seven matches earning  the couple a vacation. The situation comedy element (acted out between  rounds) followed Luddin's fictional off-stage life and encounters with his  backstage crew.    The year is 2031, and after being in cold-sleep for twenty-two years, Yuji  Kaido wakes up in the middle of a war for human survival against giant  insects called the Blue, who have overrun the Earth and have killed almost  the entire population. 
null   The series finale "I Kiss Your Shadow", with Joanne Linville and George  Grizzard as guest stars, is a story of a man crushed by the memory of his  wife's death in an automobile accident. In his book Danse Macabre, Stephen  King nominated this episode as "...the single most frightening story ever  done on TV." King wrote that Bus Stop was "...a straight drama show,... The  final episode, however, deviated wildly into the supernatural, and for me,  Robert Bloch's adaptation of his own short story "I Kiss Your Shadow" has  never been beaten on TV - and rarely any where else - for eerie, mounting  horror."    An unusual and cute Hispanic-Japanese couple is paired for a blind date. He  takes her to a Lucha Libre wrestling match, and she gets so involved, that  she cannot help jumping on the back of one of the biggest wrestler, while  the audience cheered. Later, after dinner at a Mexican restaurant, she  decides to serenade him with a song, backed by a Mariachi group. The  customers were so surprised by how terrific she could sing, that an encore  with cheers for a second song was requested, and more people kept gathering  to listen. She was asked to sign autographs like a star by the end of the  night.    In a blind date (the third and last segment of show # 59 - First Season) a  short, skinny guy who wants to date a short, sweet girl is paired with a  tall, assertive, well-endowed girl who wants to date a tall, strong guy.  They have nothing in common, until the date takes them to a "Lucha Libre"  Mexican style wrestling match. The biggest, strongest, meanest wrestler  ("Misterioso") is attracted by the girl, and decides to whisk her away  after his match, in the middle of their date. The little skinny fellow  happens to be a black belt Master. He runs after them trying to rescue the  girl by confronting the huge man, and a big fight breaks out in the parking  lot of the venue. The couple manages to run away and escape from the strong  wrestler, and the girl rewards his date's efforts with a kiss, as they  drive away full speed ahead. The crew voted on a nick-name for the little  guy: "Mighty-Mouse"    The two children of parkranger Maggie Dean who live at the base in the  Australian "Koondamoornda National park" decide to start "The bush patrol"  with a couple of friends in order to help save the bush.

null   Ambitious Prior Robert and self-serving novice Brother Columbanus instigate  a trip to Wales to bring Saint Winifred's bones back to the abbey.

When a local bigwig opposes  letting their saint leave and winds up dead, Cadfael must both prove the  innocence of a foreigner and determine whether the little Welsh girl wants  her bones left in peace.    A man, dissatisfied with his step-sons life choices, decides to leave his  manor to Shrewsbury Abbey. When the man ends up poisoned after eating food  sent from the abbey, the step-son becomes the prime suspect in the murder.  Cadfael doubts the quick assumption, sets out to find the actions and  motives behind the crime, and in the process may help to redeem himself for  a promise long unfulfilled.    Brother Cadfael, a Crusader-turned-Benedictine-monk, is among those who  tend to the bodies of an executed garrison. But when he finds one more body  than should be there, he winds up in a mystery involving an heiress  masquerading as a boy and two knights campaigning for the same maiden.    A dispute between Church and State over Fair fees leads to a brawl and the  murder of a prominent visiting merchant, supposedly by a townsman. As more  bodies are found, Cadfael starts to think the Church/State difference isn't  the cause after all.    Cadfael is sure the unlikely novice Meriet is hiding a secret, and when a  missing bishop's envoy is found dead, Meriet takes the blame. Cadfael must  discover who Meriet is protecting and who is the real murderer. Ellis  Peters fans will find the character name changes confusing and not helpful  to the story.    Prior Herluin arrives in Shrewsbury demanding that Prior Radulhus hand over  the reliquary containing the bones of the holy virgin St. Winifred.  Pilgrims to Shrewsbury have always been generous to the Abbey because of  the Holy relic and its loss may result in an economic downturn for the  Benedictines. Hurliun bases his claim on the reported visions of his novice  monk Tutilo and the burning of his abbey in the current civil war. When a  dying wealthy old woman takes a liking to the handsome Tutilo and doubts  his vocation, she bequeaths a priceless jeweled necklace to him. It is soon  obvious that the necklace is more than enough to rebuild the abbey,  Winifred's bones now seem safe at Shrewsbury, but the theft of the gems and  a resultant murder throw the issue in doubt again. Among the red herrings  facing Cadfael are a minstrel, his slave - a beautiful singer, an arrogant  nobleman, and Tutilo himself.    Young heiress Iveta de Massard comes to the abbey to marry Baron Huon de  Domville, as dictated by her guardian Godfrid Picard. Joscelyn loves her  and would protect her with his life, which makes him the prime suspect when  de Domville winds up dead. Cadfael must find the real villain from a tangle  of hidden motives and a mysterious leper who has arrived at the hospice.    In this maladaptation, the noble knight and repentant killer have become  two brothers, one of whom is blamed for their father's death. Winsome  Melangell has become a thief to support her con-artist brother (their aunt  doesn't exist). Only Cadfael is still interested in the truth, even if it  disarranges the plans of any of these unsympathetic characters.    When the Brothers find the body of a dead woman buried in a farmer's field  given to them by Lord Blount, the suspicion is that she is Generys, the  wife of one time potter Brother Ruald, who had abandoned her a year  previously to follow his vocation and joining the monastery. Ruald denies  any responsibility for his wife's death and when the identity of the victim  is brought into question, Brother Cadfael sets off to determine just who  was killed and why. While Cadfael successfully identifies the killer, there  is little that can be done to bring the culprit to justice.    Abbot Radulfus brings a hard-nosed new priest for the parish, who (among  other acts) refuses absolution to a pregnant girl who is then found dead.  He quickly becomes so hated that no one is too sorry to see him dead. But  Cadfael must not only identify his killer, but determine whether the girl  was a condemned suicide or innocent murder victim -- and his findings may  keep the girl's body out of holy ground.    Wealthy widow Judith Perle still mourns her late husband but is pursued by  numerous single townsmen. She has turned her house over to the abbey for  the rent of a single white rose each year from the house's bush. But as one  admirer is found stabbed, one of her workmen is found drowned, and Judith  herself is kidnapped, she thinks entering a convent is her only avenue to  peace. Cadfael must identify the killer in order to give Judith a chance of  happiness.    Lilwin, a traveling minstrel, entertains at the wedding feast of the son of  wealthy Walter Aurifaber but incurs the wrath of the bride's grandmother  when he accidentally breaks a piece of crockery. When the wealthy man is  apparently bludgeoned to death and a great deal of money stolen, suspicion  falls on the young man, who becomes the sparrow of the title when he seeks  sanctuary at the abbey from an angry mob. Although it later turns out that  Aurifaber survived his attacker, further complications arise from Lilwin's  romantic involvement with one of the household's serving girls, the murder  of a blackmailing gossip, and the rivalry between the young bride and her  controlling sister-in-law.    A young nun is found violated and murdered, while the brother and sister  she was escorting have disappeared. A mysterious forest ranger dedicates  himself to rescuing the children, while Brother Oswin blames himself for  Sister Hilaria's death. Cadfael must identify the killer and do what he can  to aid in the children's rescue.    In the 26th century, nature has spun wildly out of control. Cities have  crumbled and the dinosaurs have returned to rule the earth. Jack Tenrac,  one of the last of the "old blood" mechanics, along with his friends Hannah  Dundee and Mustapha, defend humanity from the greedy governor Scharnhorst,  freelance poachers, and other evil influences.

Last Friday night, John was invited to fish and chips Friday with Labour  leader David Cunliffe and his wife, Karen Price, at home in Auckland's  Herne Bay. Of course, Mr Cunliffe only became Labour leader last year, and  New Zealand learnt a lot about him in the very public contest at the time,  but Ms Price has consistently remained out of the spotlight. So who is she?  As an environmental lawyer, who was amongst the first lawyers anywhere to  study the legal ramifications of global warming, she supports her husband's  career, but does not participate in it. But now, with the election  approaching and her husband vying to be Prime Minister, she and her husband  are the fourth in our At Home with the Leaders series. And a tribute to 60  Minutes cameraman Ross Kenward.    Bronagh Key shared how on one of their first dates at an A&P show, her  then-16-year-old husband told her he wanted to be Prime Minister one day.  She said at the time she brushed the dream aside. It's a famous story, but  revealing in a striking way - a school kid who knew he wanted to be Prime  Minister, and became one. If she had the chance, Ms Key said she wouldn't  go back in time to tell her husband to change his dream of becoming Prime  Minister.

Tonight, the people with  unresolved insurance claims packed into the school hall. For this  anniversary special Earthquake Minister Gerry Brownlee, Insurance Council  chief executive Tim Grafton and EQC chief executive Ian Simpson all  declined to front . The Insurance Council was non-committal, but EQC said  it would make an appearance. Both told us late this morning they were not  fronting and cited issues surrounding their personal safety in this  environment, in light of what happened in Ashburton on Monday.

Held at the Grand Harbour  Chinese Restaurant in Auckland. TV3 was planning on hosting an MMP debate,  however Prime Minister John Key and Labour leader David Cunliffe declined  our invitation to participate, so the debate fell through. But the Campbell  Live team decided that the minor party leaders deserve a shot at your vote  on primetime television. So John hosted an hour-long special, with special  guests including Conservative Party leader Colin Craig, NZ First leader  Winston Peters, Internet Mana leader Laila Harre, Greens co-leader Metiria  Turei, United Future leader Peter Dunne, ACT Party leader Jamie Whyte and  Maori Party leader Te Ururoa Flavell.

One in three New Zealanders live in Auckland, and even if you don't, and  you hate the place, chances are your kids, or their kids, or your  neighbour's kids, will end up in Auckland at some stage. However the  average house price in Auckland is now around $700,000, land is in  desperately short supply and transport systems are struggling to cope.  Auckland is looking to places in the US who have worked on self-improvement  programmes, and really have improved. In the state of Washington, Seattle  could have had the same problems, but they don't - what did they get right?  And later in the show: last week, Auckland had a very special guest - the  commissioner of the New York City Department of Transportation from  2007-2013, Janette Sadik-Khan. It was a time of transformation; almost 300  miles of bike lanes were added and cars were given the boot from Times  Square, but why? The great forgotten truth is that great cities are great  for people, and cities only really work well if people feel safe and  welcome in them.    Rosemary Ives was shot dead by a hunter hours after beginning a weekend  camping trip in the central North Island. For the past five weeks Campbell  Live has been looking into the shopping trolley of Rohani and Richard  Alexander. Airlines and sexy ad campaigns have become standard viewing over  the years and Christiaan Van Vurren, also known as the Full Sick Rapper,  talks to Campbell Live about his cup day.    A number of New Zealand players are still waiting nervously, including  wicket-keeper Luke Ronchi; Australia has long been described as the land of  milk and honey, but with the New Zealand dollar almost on par with theirs  and the Australian unemployment rate on the rise, are there still  opportunities for Kiwis to earn big bucks? And building a homemade coffin  is around $200 we're told, but the value in human terms is incalculable.    Right now there are around 8,500 New Zealanders who live life behind bars -  8,000 of those are male, and of the 17 prisons in the country only three  are for female offenders. The biggest by far is Auckland Region Women's  Corrections Facility - so what is life on the inside for female offenders  like? Number 8 wire and DIY home handiwork are part of how we see ourselves  as Kiwis. But in order for it to be safe, the tools and materials we're  working with have to be safe too. And in hardware stores throughout the  country, there's a product that's quite simply not - in fact, it's fatally  unsafe. But it's in thousands of New Zealand homes, and it's being sold  with no warnings that it can kill; and Campbell Live's Lachlan Forsyth has  been in the kitchen with New Zealand racing cyclist Aaron Gate's  grandmother, Connie. You may remember Connie and the decadent slice she  made for Gate when he returned home from the 2012 London Olympics.    Kim Dotcom's head of security, Wayne Tempero, walks John Campbell through  the events on January 20 in a global TV exclusive; and Campbell Live talks  to Assistant Police Commissioner Malcolm Burgess, who signed off on the  Dotcom police operation.

Do we want to encourage them, make them feel valued for choosing  New Zealand over Australia?    On December 16, 2011, the GCSB began its illegal surveillance of Kim  Dotcom. Neither the Prime Minister, nor the incoming GCSB head Ian  Fletcher, were told about it. But tonight Campbell Live can reveal that Mr  Fletcher had taken leave from his job in Queensland, Australia, to be in  Wellington that week, and that he and the Prime Minister met the GCSB that  same week. Mr Key and Mr Fletcher had a secret meeting that has never  previously been revealed, despite all the requests for details of when the  pair had met during the year of Mr Fletcher's somewhat controversial  appointment to the job. With another invitation for Mr Key to Washington,  and as more is learnt about the GCSB and Five Eyes, we are beginning to see  how the organisation, and New Zealand's relationship with the US, has  changed.    Campbell Live investigates what a New Zealander "looks" like. John Campbell  talks to Willy Jackson and John Tamihere about Paul Henry's racist  comments. Three women, employed by the same man, are still waiting their  settlement for unjustified dismissal. Four Kiwi companies have found  themselves in the uncomfortable position of being the first to be posted on  the Consumer New Zealand wall of shame.

Synthetic cannabis and the impact it's having on people and communities  have been a focus of Campbell Live's in recent weeks. Despite Associate  Health Minister Peter Dunne telling John Campbell last week that banning  the substances wasn't the answer, he has now announced he's doing just that  in two weeks' time. Campbell Live reporters travelled across the country to  gauge reaction to the upcoming ban and what it means for users, and those  who make a living selling legal highs.

Over the past two years Campbell Live has repeatedly drawn attention to the  problem of hungry children, but the reality is almost 250,000 kids still  live in poverty. It is a statistic that is painfully hard to fathom - could  that much poverty really exist in this beautiful land of milk and honey?

For Te Aroha couple Tobi Lawton and Sarah Lee, the beginning of 2014 was  filled with dread as they found themselves in a termite-infested home. The  first-home buyers faced bankruptcy as their dream home was literally  disintegrating before their eyes. It was considered one of the worst  termite infestations to ever invade a New Zealand home.    It's St John's annual appeal next week, and often in emergencies there's no  charge, even when they save your life. The work they do, at accidents, at  scenes of violence, at sports events, in workplaces, schools and homes, can  be stressful, bloody and life-saving. Two Fridays ago, cameraman Grant  Findlay and reporter Ali Ikram took an astonishing ride with a St John's  crew, in Auckland; and they may be convenient, but there's a price to pay  for shopping at a supermarket. They're one of the most expensive places to  buy your fruit and vegetables - and here's the proof.

Powerboats are fast, powerful, and unpredictable for a dolphin, and would  carry unthinkable consequences; and when the mining boom began in  Australia, for many New Zealanders it appeared to be the pot of gold at the  end of the trans-Tasman rainbow.    Just 48 hours after New Zealand's general election, John Key sat down with  John Campbell in Wellington after he was elected for another three years as  Prime Minister. "I will lead a Government that will govern for all New  Zealanders" was a quote from Mr Key's acceptance speech that stood out for  many.

In a small Pennsylvania town of the turn of the century, an independent and  sympathetic druggist operates a haven for all the town characters. He comes  to the aid of old Miss Harrington, who is trying to convince the community  that she recently had a successful European concert career.    Albert Campion --a bespectacled aristocrat of many pseudonyms, who moves  amongst the high class as easily as the the crime underworld-- loves  detection and adventure. Aided by his burglar-turned-manservant  Magersfontein Lugg, and his policeman friend Stanislaus Oates, Campion  unravels eight mysteries over the course of the series. Set in the 1930s,  the series is based upon the works of English crime writer Margery  Allingham. 
null   Jimmy Sutane, a popular musical comedy star is to appear in a show based on  a book by a friend of Campion. He is also being plagued by a series of  practical jokes that are beginning to undermine his self-confidence and  asks Campion to his house,White Walls, to investigate. Associates of Sutane  and his wife Linda number 'Squire' Mercer, a talented musician and Chloe  Pye, a washed-up actress.When Chloe is run over and killed by Jimmy Sutane  in his car he swears it was an accident, but others are not so sure.    A second death occurs, that of Sutane's under-study, who had been playing  the tricks on him to get out of the way so that he could take the lead  role. Attracted to Sutane's wife Linda, Campion is not wholly convinced of  Sutane's innocence until it is discovered that 'Squire' Mercer and Chloe  Pye had once been a married couple and that she had come onto the scene to  get back with him.    Campion is invited by Belle, respected widow of late painter John  Lafcadio,to attend an unusual ceremony. It is an annual event at which one  painting at a time, left unseen at the time of the artist's death, is  unveiled. Ill-mannered painter Tommy Dacre upsets the event, insulting  dotty old Donna Beatrice, as former Lafcadio model and revealing he has  brought a new fiancee home, to the chagrin of his old  girl-friend,Lafcadio's grand-daughter Linda. The lights go out and when  they are turned on again Dacre is dead, Max Fustian, a supercilious art  dealer, admits to the killing but no arrests are made for lack of  proof.After Dacre's art works gradually disappear, there is a second  murder, of alcoholic picture restorer Claire Potter, in her studio in  Belle's garden.    Claire Potter proves to have been poisoned and, on the day of her death,  had taken in a wood-block from Max Fustian for cleaning, as well as a  mysterious parcel, the second of its kind. Campion starts to surmise that  both the victims were killed because they were engaged in faking Lafcadio  paintings for the unveiling ceremonies,since he has no outstanding output  at his death. In unmasking the killer Campion accepts an invitation that  almost leads to his own demise.    At the Golden Quill publishing house Paul Brand is at odds with his  partners the Barnabas cousins - notably stuffy senior partner John - over  publication of a rare manuscript by William Congreve. Then he is found  murdered, locked in the firm's basement with a hose piping poisonous car  fumes through a hole in the window. Michael Barnabas, a friend of Campion,  is in love with the dead man's wife who, at the inquest, makes it clear  that she and her husband were filing for divorce. Consequently Michael is  charged with the murder.    Trying to prove his friend's innocence Campion makes several discoveries,  including the fact that the murder was an exact copy of one in a book  published by the Golden Quill. The dead man also had a mistress, who tells  Campion that there was more than the one key to the basement and that Paul  Brand had recently had one cut for himself. Plainly Brand was murdered  because he had found out something about the William Congreve manuscript  which somebody wanted keeping quiet.    Campion and Lugg agree to help a prominent British family protect the Gryth  Chalice from a gang of thieves and cutthroats. In addition to the flesh and  blood threats, an aunt dies after being cursed by the village witch and  Lugg is attacked by a monster in the woods.    After capturing the neighborhood witch in the act of haunting a woodland  glade, Campion learns the name of the gang leader who is trying to steal  the Gyrth's chalice. Campion is captured and imprisoned in a stable with a  murderous horse while the gang readies to assault the Gyrth's stronghold.    On a transatlantic liner Campion saves the life of American Judge Lobbett,  who has been the victim of several attempts to kill him. His son Marlowe  tells Campion he is being pursued by a vengeful gangster known as Simister,  whose mob he imprisoned. Arriving in England Campion billets the judge,  daughter Isopel and Marlowe with Giles and Biddy Pagett in their country  home in East Anglia on a road called Mystery Mile. They are visited by  Anthony Datchett,a sinister palmist who tells their fortunes and next day  the local vicar, who spoke to Datchett, kills himself. Soon afterwards,  having called in art dealer Alistair Barber to value one of Giles'  paintings, the judge mysteriously disappears.    Biddy Pagett is abducted and Campion learns from his London informant  Thomas Knapp that Datchett, a known blackmailer, has got her, believing she  knows where the judge is. Campion leads a rescue party which frees Biddy  and Datchett and his gang are all arrested. Campion then confesses that he  helped Judge Lobbett to disappear for his own safety but believes that the  time is right for him to re-appear and act as bait to flush out and  identify Simister. Having accomplished this, Campion has still to discover  why the vicar committed suicide.    When elderly Harriet Huntingforest is attacked by an intruder who flees  empty-handed Campion links the incident to the fact that she is aunt to the  three young Fitton siblings, whose family once tried to prove a claim to a  title which would give them the throne of the Dalmatian state of Averna.  Posing as tourists he and Lugg arrive in the village of Pontisbright to  stay with the family. A further intrusion leads Campion to confront wealthy  tycoon Brett Savanake, who also wants the papers which will give him the  Avernan crown and who has Campion shanghaied.    Savanake's heavies arrive in Pontisbright whilst the Fittons finally  discover the charter that could prove their claim, though it is stolen - by  Campion, who has escaped from Savanake. Lugg takes it to London to be  authenticated and the Fittons seem closer to gaining the throne of Averna.  First,however, they are invited to dinner with the sinister village doctor,  who may well be in Savanake's pay, whilst Savanake himself arrives in the  village for a fight to the death with Campion.    Campion receives an enigmatic anonymous letter alerting him to the death of  a old schoolmate, nicknamed "The Pig" who bullied and hazed him when he was  younger. Three months later he is recruited by Sir Leo Pursuivant to help  him investigate the murder of a man who was planning an unpopular  development project in the area. Somewone evidently pushed a heavy concrete  urn from an upper balcony which fell onto his head. TRhe corpse looks like  "The Pig" or a close relative, but the investigation is thwarted when the  body mysteriously disappears.    Some people find religion, but for 16-year-old Godou Kusanagi, it's  religion that's found him! As the result of defeating the God of War in  mortal combat, Godou received the position of Campione, or God Slayer,  whose duty is to fight Heretical Gods whenever and wherever they appear and  start changing things to suit themselves, usually at the expense of the  people in the area. Not only is this likely to make Godou begin his  recognition in Heaven, it's also a job that comes along with a lot of other  problems. One of the problems would be to deal with the fact that his  enhanced status keeps attracting attention and difficult girls. In  particular, the demonically manipulative sword-mistress Erica Blandelli,  who strongly and extremely forwardly expresses her love for him, which  usually creates awkward and misunderstood situations for him. (Campione is  the Italian word for Champion. Everyone calls God Slayers Campione as the  earliest known record describing the Campione was written by an Italian,  hence the Italian form is used by everybody regardless of nationality.) 
null   The kidnapping of Julie McCandless comes to a violent end when Julie and  Tyler are held at gunpoint in the deserted farmhouse barn by Sandy Vincent,  sent by crime lord Josh Harrington to leave no witnesses. Meanwhile, in  Jeffersonia, Sam Clegg unleashes his anger on daughter Brenda, and Zed  Diamond begs Julie's lookalike Jenny to leave with him.    Freely adapted from Jorge Amado's novel, "Capit�es de Areia" tells the  story of very young outsiders, homeless children and teenagers, living in  Salvador, State of Bahia, Brazil. Harassed by the police, their only friend  is a priest, who tries to understand them.    With his company's stock falling in price and unable to meet the contract  to provide 100,000 Cylon robots in a month, Daniel Graystone has no choice  but to sell his sports team to Tomas Vergis. With only a week to deliver  the duplicated MCPs, he also decides to wipe the chip clean and mass  produce a blank copy. Daniel's decision forces Zoe to reveal herself.  Sister Clarice decides to face Barnabas and the internal challenge to her  leadership of the STO head on. Barnabas isn't going to take it lying down  and he comes through for Lacy but he expects her to perform a task for him.  Amanda's mental condition continues to deteriorate. Sam is concerned about  Joseph's apparent addiction to the v-world. Emmanuelle confronts Tamara in  an effort to get her to help her father and her solution is quite drastic.    In New Cap City, Joseph Adama continues to follow Emmanuelle who introduces  him to a drug - essentially a hack - to keep him in the game. He has  trouble with the violence he finds there but his brother Sam has a  suggestion for him. Daniel Graystone is now convinced that Zoe's avatar  hasn't been lost but is inside the Cylon. He thinks he has a way to get to  her but she's one step ahead of him. Amanda Graystone continues to see her  dead brother and has flashbacks to the night he died. Tomas Vergis tells  her about Daniel's theft of the MCP.    Daniel Graystone gives in to the demands of his company's public relations  experts and decides to go on talk show to talk about what Zoe has done and  atone somewhat for any responsibility he wears for the terrorist attack.  The decision to do so doesn't sit well with wife Amanda who now feels she  misspoke and that they shouldn't blame Zoe for what has happened. The  public appearance doesn't start well but Daniel gets help from an  unexpected source. The police continue to investigate the crime and manage  to get a warrant to search Zoe's and other's lockers at her school. The  agent also get a warrant to search the Graystones' house but find nothing  there either. Joseph Adama meanwhile pursues his revenge and sends his  brother Sam to balance the score before he has second thoughts.    Daniel Graystone's longtime rival Tomas Vergis, a Tauron, reappears on the  scene. Vergis accuses Daniel of stealing the MCP chip technology from him,  something Daniel denies. He visits Joseph Adama to find out how Vergis got  his information. Sister Clarice visits Amanda Graystone, with interesting  results. Joseph Adama meanwhile buys himself a holoband, intent on finding  Tamara. He also tracks down the young man who told him of Tamara's  existence.    Some 58 years before the events in Battle Star Galactica, a series of  events bring two families together that will have an indelible impact on  human-kind. Daniel Graystone is a successful entrepreneur having introduced  major advances in technology, most notably the holopad that allows users to  immerse themselves in a holographic world of their own designs. Joseph  Adama is a Tauron refugee who has successfully established himself on  Caprica and is a lawyer for the Tauron gangster community that paid for his  legal training. Unbeknown to Graystone, his daughter Zoe has become a  member of an organization that has monotheistic religious beliefs but is  regarded as a terrorist organization by some, including the government.  When Zoe and a friend are killed in an explosion set off by Zoe's boyfriend  Dan, Adama's wife and daughter are also killed. As Daniel explores his  daughter's personal holographic world, he finds that she has created an  avatar of herself that is so realistic, he tries to download her image into  a cybernetic being he is developing for the government.    Daniel Graystone believes his attempt to download Zoe's avatar into a  cybernetic being has failed but is pleased when the soldier-cyborgs he is  developing for the government finally seems to be working. He does not  realize that Zoe's persona remains and is the edge that is finally making  his latest invention work. Avatar Zoe is soon in touch with her close  friend Lacy Rand and together they try to make sense of what has happened  to her. Zoe's mother Amanda, still overwrought by their loss, attends a  public memorial service for the victims of the explosion but realizing just  how little she knew about her daughter, makes a startling public  announcement. Joseph Adama is trying to keep his son William on the  straight and narrow and desperately wants to visit his avatar daughter. In  the final test of his new cyborg-soldier, Daniel Graystone wins praise from  government officials for his new cybernetic life-form node, which he calls  Cylons for short.    The Graystones begin to pay a heavy price for Amanda's public declaration  that Zoe was a terrorist who was involved in blowing up the train. She  resigns her position at the hospital and is stalked by paparazzi. The  company's stock is dropping like a lead balloon and Daniel refuses to  launch a publicity campaign to try and set things right. He also has to  deal with Joseph Adama who insists that he find a way for him to visit with  his avatar daughter. Joseph's brother Sam adds a little muscle to be  persuasive. Meanwhile, Zoe's avatar has found a way to re-enter the holopad  world.    Amanda Graystone continues to struggle with all of the events in her life  and now thinks she' seen her dead brother Darius. Sister Clarice befriends  her convinced that determining Zoe's present state will give her the  understanding of life ever after. Knowing that Sister Clarice is looking  for her and may interfere with her leaving Caprica, Zoe pushes Lacey to  finalize arrangements for their departure while trying to arrange for her  own escape, in Cylon form, from her father's lab. Lacey has run into  problems however. Joseph Adama has tracked down Tad Thorean and gets him to  show where Tamara's avatar is to be found. Tad tries to explain to him that  she isn't real but Joseph doesn't quite see it that way. In New Cap City,  Joseph continues to learn the rules but is soon on his own. Daniel  Graystone continues to spar with rival Tomas Vergis.    Tamara Adama is still trying to make sense of her "life" in her new world.  She doesn't understand where she is or why she's there. She does begin to  realize that she is not a pure game creation nor is she a human who has  entered the game via a holoband. Or at least not a conscious human, which  is one of the suggestions put to her to explain how she fits in. She's  become friendly with a young man who spends most of his life in the  cyberworld preferring it to "real" life. She asks him to contact her  father. Joseph Adama meanwhile realizes that unless he can put his wife and  Tamara's death behind him, his son William will take a path in life that  will no doubt lead to a life of crime.    Zoe's search for Tamara within the cruel V-World comes to an end as Zoe is  shocked to see what Tamara has become. Lacy struggles to keep Zoe's secrets  amidst Clarice's physical and psychological torture. The conflict between  Daniel and Vergis comes to a violent head.    Daniel is grieving the loss of his company, his daughter and his wife.  Vergis has taken over Graystone Industries and is mass producing Cylon  Centurians. Daniel goes to Joseph and the Guatrau for help against Vergis.  Zoe enters New Cap City. Clarice is visiting the STO on Gemenon and runs  into problems trying to convince them to follow her vision of apotheosis.  And she has a traveling companion.

For those still on board, the "Tiger Cruise" provides a buffer, but there's  no such transition for those who fly home early from Hawaii.

Many aspects of life on a nuclear  aircraft carrier are hush-hush. Dating and sex aboard ship are strictly  forbidden, but according to one sailor, with 5,000 people on board,  relationships are "inevitable," resulting in a "don't ask, don't tell"  policy that applies to relationships as well as sexual orientation.

The iconic producer created a massive number of hit series like Charlie's  Angels, The Love Boat and Beverly Hills 90210. By the time he died at 83  years old, he left behind a monumental fortune, and a raging family feud  that refused to die down. The plot twists are worthy of one of his  best-known shows - Dynasty.    Former Guess Girl, playboy Playmate, Marilyn Monroe lookalike and Reality  TV star Anna Nicole Smith was a tabloid sensation in the 90s and early  2000s. Smith was as famous for her addictions and lavish lifestyle as she  was for her curves and charisma.

Fueled by grief and despair the Bessette family goes  after the Kennedy's seeking retribution.    John Lennon, founding member of The Beatles, was one of the greatest  singers and songwriters of all time. A peace activist and multi millionaire  Lennon was shot dead by a crazed fan.

null   Slatt publicly humiliates pupil Maureen Bullivant so on parents' evening  her big brother arrives seeking revenge - in the form of a Bungee rope  which he attaches to Slatt. Unfortunately this means Slatt is unable to  retrieve the revealing medical photos of Janet which he had advised Jason  to put up around the school to shame his wife. Furthermore,thanks to the  jealous Dan,the pupils believe that Jason is Satan and,given his reaction  to the photos,Jason also believes it. Miraculously though Slatt manages to  safeguard Janet's honour - even as he is flying through the air.    Suzy has had a terrible dream,in which she is having sex with Slatt,a fact  which becomes known to the rest of the staff after she has told Dan in  confidence and to the whole school when she fails to realize the P.A.  system is on when she tells Slatt. As a result they go out of their way to  avoid each other,a fact which confuses new student Bartholomew,a boy who  has previously suffered from a split personality and hearing voices.  Ultimately Suzy finds she is actually drawn to Slatt - or is this also a  dream?    Slatt wants to get rid of Amanda,whom he regards as wholly incompetent,and  when education officer Archie Munt arrives at the school he thinks he has  his chance. In fact Archie has tracked Amanda down as they have been  regularly sending each other erotic emails and they embark upon a night of  passion. Next day the married Archie has no more use for Amanda and  recommends that she be sacked but help for her comes from an unexpected  quarter - Eric Slatt.    At the end of year staff party Janet embarks upon an affair with Jason  whilst Dan and Suzy find and play a video tape of Slatt addressing his  unborn child,which gets played to all the teachers. However it reveals that  Slatt is not impotent as he had led everybody to believe but covering up  Janet's infertility ,which leads to a marital reunion.    Suzy discovers that,in order to keep his job as a language teacher,Dan has  invented a new tongue,Estransian,based on the non-existent country of  Estransia,whose history he has taught to his class. During an after hours  staff meeting pupil Gail Bennett locks all the teachers in the staff-room  as a protest against human rights abuse in Estransia. A TV camera crew  arrives to cover the event. Unfortunately Slatt is desperate for a pee and  chooses to relieve himself out of the window as the cameras start to roll.    Newly-qualified Suzy Travis arrives to teach English at Galfast High school  and finds the place in typical chaos. English master Mr Humphrey has been  dead at his desk for a day and the solution of boorish,hyper-manic deputy  Eric Slatt is to shut him in a cupboard. Confusion arises when Suzy  discovers the headmaster is hiding in an identical cupboard and Slatt  refuses to believe her. She is,however,befriended by nervous colleague  Amanda Trippley and the admiring Dan McGill.    Galfast High is awaiting an inspection and Slatt is only too aware that the  inspectors are looking to close down one of the area's schools. Thus,when a  trio of inspectors arrives,it is unfortunate that there are no pupils  because Amanda has sacked them all. The staff make frantic efforts to stall  the inspectorate whilst the pupils are rounded up but fortunately Suzy uses  a little psychology to persuade the inspectors that they are so stressed  out that they are unable to see the pupils even though they are there.    Slatt and headmaster Nixon are awaiting an interview panel for a job at a  new school and Slatt sees it as his chance to escape Galfast and his wife  Janet,the school secretary. Unfortunately the interview does not go well  as,apart from his usual ineptitude,he impersonates a female colleague to  impress a blind interviewer and is caught kissing him by the other panel  members. It seems Nixon will get the job - until he turns up stoned out of  his head after visiting the prefects' common room.    As new headmaster J.F. Kennedy tries to stem the rising tide of self abuse  in the school enthusiastic student teacher Ronald Longland arrives,unphased  by the apathy of the staff. Slatt takes a dislike to him,sticking a notice  saying 'Pervert' to Ronald's bottom,and his efforts to retrieve it  ultimately lead to Slatt pretending to be gay - though it does afford a  grateful Ronald to admit to his mother that he is genuinely gay.    Pupil Helen Williams has an inexplicable crush on Slatt and comes to school  with her new twins,both called Eric,claiming Slatt is the father. New young  R.I. teacher Jason Cockfoster is shocked by this impropriety,the more so  when Slatt loses his trousers and demands the young teacher give him his.  Jason finds Helen's scrapbook in praise of her idol Pumpman but when the  police and the real father arrive at the school it is clear from the  trouserless Slatt's attributes that he is not the stud Helen claims him to  be.    Dr Eleanor Gillespie arrives at the school to supervise the A Level Maths  exam and is immediately mistaken for a specialist by the headmaster who is  having stomach problems. Slatt hopes star pupil Edward Arthur will do the  school proud but after Slatt has accidentally killed the boy's pet rabbit  and put his pop idol in hospital - by ringing him on his car mobile asking  for a good luck message and causing a crash - Edward loses all interest in  school subjects. Dr Gillespie threatens to ruin Slatt's career. Can the  headmaster's bowel movement perhaps miraculously save him?    It's the day of the staff versus students football match and Suzy is  appalled to see Slatt use dirty tricks to nobble the pupils' star player.  Whilst in his study she sees an urn with his mother's name on it and  assumes she is dead but it is merely wishful thinking on Slatt's part  as,when mother arrives at the school,she is the spitting image of Janet.  With the head also assuming that mother is dead Slatt behaves even more  bizarrely than usual - especially when,due to his list of exclusions from  the side,he is the only member of the teachers' football team.    Rudy Tabootie's a regular kid with a very special possession: a magical  piece of chalk that lets him enter ChalkZone, a world beyond the  chalkboard.

null   Changing Seas is a public television series produced by WPBT2 in Miami,  Florida. Narrated by well-known voice talent Peter Thomas, this series  takes viewers on an exciting adventure to the heart of our liquid planet.  The oceans cover roughly 70 percent of the earth's surface and they contain  97 percent of the world's water supply. Nevertheless, only five percent of  their vast expanse has been explored - leaving in secret a deep, liquid  wilderness yet to be discovered. Regardless, the oceans have long played an  important role in people's lives. Currently, more than half of all  Americans live within 50 miles of the coast, and that number is rising. It  is estimated that by 2025 more than 75 percent of Americans will live along  the country's shorelines. Coastal and marine waters support 28 million jobs  and draw 189 million tourists a year. While the population's dependence on  the oceans as a natural resource and a source for recreation continues to  increase, the health of these large bodies of water is rapidly declining.  Over-fishing, global climate change, pollution: these are only a few of the  threats that the oceans are facing today. At the same time, the seas hold  great promise for ongoing medical research, as an untapped source of  alternate energy, and other benefits that scientists are just now beginning  to discover. Changing Seas goes to sea with explorers and scientists as  they uncover new information that could lead to scientific breakthroughs.  This documentary series lets viewers experience first-hand how  oceanographers and other experts study earth's last frontier, and it sheds  light on how human activities are threatening ocean resources.

null   After being held incommunicado behind the Iron Curtain for seven years and  declared legally dead, Tom Roberts returns to the United States and  discovers that his wife, Mary, has remarried and has a son. Even though the  second marriage was annulled and Tom and Mary have remarried, there's still  the question of custody of the child, Johnny, to be decided. During the  trial testimony reveals that Tom and Mary plan to move to Rome, Italy, and  the birth father will have little communication with his son. Will that  sway the jury to award custody to a single man?    The tale takes place on the island of New Providence in the Bahamas. This  unique place of piracy, theft and outlaws is reigned by the fearsome pirate  captain Edward Teach, known as Blackbeard. But a scheme has been designed  to throw Blackbeard from his throne. An assassin, Tom Lowe, is sent with  the task to execute the pirate leader. However, as Lowe moves closer  towards Blackbeard, he starts to admire his ideas and involvement in the  rogue society. And of course, Lowe will not be Blackbeard's only enemy. 
null   Balfour overhears Lowe confess to Kate of being an English spy sent to kill  Blackbeard and he tells Selima, who sends pirates to find Lowe.  Antoinette's torture continues at the hands of Jagger, now using Lowe's  sketchbook as evidence that Edward "Blackbeard" Teach is alive. To comfort  herself, she recites an encrypted rhyme. Jagger cracks the code - the  chronometer Blackbeard sold to the Spanish will lead the fleet to a  surprise attack from Blackbeard himself, the only one who knows where the  Spaniards, and their treasure, will be.    Having learned of Blackbeard's plans to attack innocent civilians in  Jamaica, Lowe devises a way to report back to his spymaster, William  Jagger. But having done so, Lowe discovers that Jagger might be an even  greater madman than the Commodore. The time has come to make a choice  between two evils. Which way will he jump?

On board the Petrel is Tom  Lowe, an English spy working undercover as ship's surgeon. Lowe's mission  is to prevent the Chronometer from falling into the hands of pirates - and  if the opportunity should arise, to assassinate Blackbeard.    When Kate is captured on a trading voyage, Blackbeard and Lowe must work  together in order to rescue her before she reveals the island's whereabouts  to William Jagger. In the process, Lowe discovers that Blackbeard has an  ulterior, deeply personal motive for keeping him on Santa Compana.    Lowe plots to kidnap Blackbeard and deliver him to the English authorities,  believing this to be the only way to save the people of Santa Compana from  the mad wrath of William Jagger. Meanwhile, Jagger visits an insane asylum,  believing a patient there will be the key to finally defeating Blackbeard.

null   Da Vinci meets with an old buddy from his police days, Nelson Horner, who  has been doing some work for the Solicitor General's office. He gives Da  Vinci a head's up that he is "being set up to take a big hit" due to the  Mayor's controversial policies, further fueled by the murder in the red  light district. This action stems from a war between the SG's office and  the Attorney General's office and control of the police force. They both  suspect that Jacobs has his fingers in the mix somewhere. Immediately  following, Berger gets a call from Feeney of the SG's office for a meeting  with the Mayor; Feeney tells Da Vinci that the SG is concerned about the  grow-op shooting and the non-cooperation and animosity of both the police  department and fire and rescue in the Police Complaints Commission. He  strongly suggests Da Vinci quietly resolve these problems, including  disciplining Jacobs if necessary. The next morning, the Police Complaints  Commission releases their report with an inconclusive outcome, although the  report highlights many problems both with the grow-op investigation and the  non-cooperation by both departments in the commission. Although bothered by  the result, Jacobs and Klotchko place a positive spin on the "no blame"  aspect of the report and launch their own internal investigation of the  non-cooperation aspect. In other words, they plan to sandbag Constables  Ferris, Winters and Jones. The fire department is incensed by the  inconclusive finding and Komori leads the department in job action by not  wearing their uniforms on the job - Welles is not happy with Komori's  action. In a further discussion with Rosen on his file folder of 53  complaints against the conduct of the police department, Da Vinci urges him  to take the complaints directly to the SG's office based on the  Commission's report and the discussion with Feeney. Da Vinci realizes that  this will result in an investigation of the entire police department  including the Police Board on which he as Mayor is Chair. This does occur,  with the relationship between Da Vinci and Jacobs as part of the  investigation. Independent with each and without each's knowledge of the  other, Mah uses her charms to ease relations and get both Forrest and  Sweeney, the fire and police union reps respectively, on side with the  City's agenda despite the Commission report. With the red light district  murder, Savoy questions Roberta and some prostitutes. Rumors abound the red  light zone, the only common thread being that it was robbery-based. Savoy  later finds that the murder looks to be the result of a known on-going  domestic dispute, good news for the City and the state of the red light  district. Webber, a City lawyer, speaks to Da Vinci regarding the civil  suit launched by Mina Basra regarding the City's sanctioning of the zone  and thus their role in the murder; Webber states that they should be  prepared despite the City not being liable. Basra has hired one of the  City's most expensive law firms, tipping Da Vinci to the fact that her  campaign is being financed by a powerful third party. Mah uncovers the fact  that Billie Simms' and Basra are related by marriage and that Simms'  husband is a partner in the law firm. Thus Da Vinci decides to confront her  on his suspicion that she is Basra's financier and is working against him  on the red light zone issue. Despite the facts, she denies the allegations  - she states that he is her ex-husband and she and Basra may have once been  distantly related. Regardless of the real truth, Da Vinci suggest that they  strike a deal to publicly support each other's priorities. With the  pedophile case, Jacobs is ready to arrest Dubreau on homicide charges based  on evidence that he was in the Century Club with one of the deceased  aboriginal boys, this regardless of the state of the Coroner's office  investigation. An insider informs Curtis of this, who in turns tips off  Dubreau's people, stating that Dubreau should leave the country immediately  and permanently. Due to Dubreau's escape to Costa Rica, a country with  which Canada does not have an extradition agreement, Leary, on Kelly's  advice, decides to raid the Century Club with Kosmo and Finn on a Coroner's  warrant instead. The on duty clerk at the club, Mason, offers some  resistance to the raid, but later does cooperate. He admits to knowledge of  the activities of members of the club inside its premises, as well as  admits to making travel arrangements for members fleeing the country to  avoid police charges. He also distinctly remembers the situation with  Dubreau and the 2 murdered boys specifically because the boys were younger  than the usual. Mason also states that Dubreau had a penchant for native  boys. On City business, Lloyd Manning once again brings up the issue of the  City ad contract; he has evidence that bribes were issued by Pacific Comm  to political officials. Councillor Ferlinger later speaks to Da Vinci  saying that the RCMP Commercial Crimes Division has interrogated her on the  issue based on evidence supplied by Manning. Although she said nothing to  the Horsemen, Ferlinger admits to Da Vinci that she does know of bribery  associated with the contract, but it was not she who accepted a bribe but  rather Da Vinci's friend on Council, Jack Pierce - Pierce confesses to  this. Da Vinci convinces him to cut a deal with the Crown, offer his  resignation, and not implicate the current administration. Manning states  that he doesn't want blood from the City or Pierce, but is solely out for  financial gain from Pacific Comm as a businessman, this perhaps allowing  Pierce to come out of the incident not totally scathed. With the homeless  issue, McNab and Friedland are now working in cahoots with each other  seeing that each knows the other's real background. They work in an effort  to advance a housing project for the tent city squatters.    Four on-going story-lines take a back seat in this episode. First, Curtis  approaches all the witnesses in the Dubreau case to leave quietly, quickly  and semi-permanently to Mexico, all to be paid by Dubreau. These witnesses  include Zappata (who agrees), Mason (who shuns Curtis and continues to  cooperate with Leary) and Messner (who is adamant about not running away,  but vows not to discredit Dubreau). Second, Klotchko continues his  sandbagging of the grow-op constables, especially of Ferris. After Matthews  in Internal interviews the three constables, she recommends that Ferris be  placed under preventative psychiatric care. Third, Katie cooperates on the  gay bashing murder. Under interrogation, she places all the blame on Clay  and especially Reed, who she paints as being homophobic. And fourth, Woo  threatens to shut the Hastings Park racetrack and move all his business to  his new property in Delta. This threat includes a letter to the racetrack  union to that fact. The main attraction of the episode is the Police  Complaints Commission investigation and the on-going battle between Da  Vinci and Jacobs. The Commission is looking for any correspondence to/from  Da Vinci in his dealings with the police and regarding the grow-op  procedure. They approach Komori as such, as well issue a search warrant for  the Mayor's office - they get all that is listed in the warrant but not  everything they want, which includes access to Da Vinci's computer. Feeney  from the Solicitor General's office interviews Jacobs and Klotchko  regarding Da Vinci's conduct with the police, Jacobs obviously putting as  negative a spin on all situations. Da Vinci finally confront Kaspar  regarding the heavy-handedness of the approach, however Kaspar stands his  ground and states all will be fair. He also informs Da Vinci that Jacobs  has filed a complaint against the Mayor and Police Board about conduct. Da  Vinci accuses Jacobs of the misconduct, including a cover up, which piques  Kaspar's interest, pending evidence to the fact. Da Vinci tries to enlist  Leary's assistance, as if he issues a report that there was cover-up in the  grow-op shooting, Jacobs doesn't have a leg on which to stand. On a public  relations level, Da Vinci gets pushed aside from speaking at the  Policeman's Ball by Jacobs, but Da Vinci insists as the Police Chair he  attend and say a few words. There is a final change of plans when an  informational protest by some uniforms is set up outside the ball regarding  the Mayor's secret cross-training initiative. The protest was initiated by  the unions as Sweeney obtained a memo from the Mayor to that fact, the memo  which he shared with Forrest. Much of the overall maneuvering is thought to  surround the Mayor's red light zone initiative. There is good news for the  Mayor on that front when Margaret Fielding gives herself up as the  perpetrator of the red light zone murder. She admits that the victim was  her boyfriend Charles Waring, who was forcibly trying to take her into  rehab. With the red light issue itself, Da Vinci and Manning try to  negotiate a deal: Manning will get the PM to publicly support the red light  zone, while Da Vinci will act as intermediary with Pacific Comm and the ad  contract - these negotiations end unresolved.    A band of renegade police constables, led by Jan Ferris, start raiding  suspected grow-ops. Da Vinci's team meets with Tom Venice, the race track  owner, to discuss measures to save the track such as installing slot  machines, but Da Vinci is more interested in the attractive and wealthy  Billie Simms, a stable owner at the track. Zack continues his undercover  work at the squat at the Watson's Building. After Zack tells them that  Friedland plans to move the squat to touristy Queen Elizabeth Park, Da  Vinci and Mah tell Zack to try and manipulate a move to Crab Park instead,  which is on federal land and thus would additionally become a federal  problem. Da Vinci tries to find the leak in City Hall regarding the  advertising contract, the leak either in the Administrator's office or on  the previous Council. Initial evidence points to Councillor Ferlinger, who  admits to the evidence being correct but denies she being the leak. Kosmo  and Finn continue their investigation of the half-way house shooting, with  the constable on the scene admitting that he used a stun gun on the  attacking dog, and in the ensuing scuffle with the dog's owner, who was  wielding a machete, he and his partner shot the man. The constable decides  to speak to a lawyer before deciding to hand or not hand over the stun gun.  As the investigation of the half-way house shooting is going on, Jacobs  attacks Da Vinci publicly about the shooting being the result of his soft  policies of drugs. Irked, Da Vinci starts the process to find a new Police  Chief. Kosmo and Finn also investigate a fatal stabbing at a pawn shop.  Leary starts his investigation of the two dead aboriginal boys, Garth and  Dennis, whose bodies were buried fifteen years prior. Clark Messner, who  knew Garth and Dennis, recounts stories from them of a wealthy pedophile  john who continually picked up aboriginal boys. Carter leads the  investigation of the beating death in Stanley Park. Councillor Horne  presses him to prosecute the crime as a gay bashing regardless of the  evidence.    The OCU's report on the grow-op shooting is released, the report stating  that there was a fire department inspection notice posted which was a major  cause of the outcome. Most officials are not happy with the report findings  and question the accuracy of the report, these including Da Vinci, Savoy,  Leary, Komori, Welles and Forrest. Although Jacobs is satisfied, he still  needs to carefully spin the report findings. He and Klotchko decide to lay  whatever police blame on Ferris' shoulders. But Ferris decides she is not  going away, so Klotchko needs to do something to placate her in her chosen  career path. Leary is still doing his independent investigation of the  incident, but a pissed off Welles decides to file a formal complaint to the  police complaints commission. Not wanting an all-out war between the police  and fire & rescue, Da Vinci tries to intervene, which may be a misstep on  his part. At City Hall, Da Vinci and his team do their last minute  canvassing for the slot machine support, tying the slots to the hiring of  more police officers. And Da Vinci's negotiations with the Port Authority  and Billie Simms about development on the waterfront and the transfer of  Crab Park to the City proceeds to a near conclusion. The squat at Crab Park  seems to be a long term proposition, but McNab's bigger concern is finding  out more about the man calling himself Joe Friedland. With the  investigation on the pedophile ring, Curtis tries to insinuate himself into  the investigation to cover his own tracks. After conferring with Homicide,  Leary does speak to Curtis to try and get whatever valuable information  about the basic framework of the pedophile ring, especially Dubreau's  involvement, while taking any information about Curtis' own involvement  with a grain of salt.    Relations between the police department and fire & rescue continue to be  strained. The latest incident involves a suicide jumper, each side accusing  that the other was at fault for possibly not preventing the death. Kaspar,  the police complaints commissioner, has decided to pursue fire & rescue's  complaint regarding the grow-op shooting. Da Vinci warns Kaspar, being part  of the RCMP which has in the past had strained relations with the Vancouver  Police Department, that the investigation should be impartial. Welles is  satisfied that the complaint is moving forward and he will accept whatever  the outcome, whereas Jacobs is pissed off that it is proceeding at all.  Jacobs and Klotchko advise their members not to cooperate with Kaspar,  Ferris and Arkin who agree. Chick may be a tougher one for them to  convince. With other business, both Da Vinci and Jacobs try to muscle in on  the Prime Minister's upcoming visit to Vancouver. This task seems  difficult, especially for the mayor, who wants the PM to tour the Red Light  District. Jacobs does whatever he can to kibosh the mayor's plans, but the  mayor does manage to get his wish, in part because the PM wants to recruit  Da Vinci to run for his party either federally or for the provincial  premiership. The tour, however, does not go as smoothly as Da Vinci would  have hoped. With the Hastings Racecourse, the slot machine vote does not  pass due to some unexpected councilor votes. The vote ends up being  somewhat immaterial as Manning, the day previous, sold the racecourse to  Roger Woo, who expects some concessions from the mayor to keep the track  operating, namely three casino licenses. But Sandra Ferlinger, the  councilor who switched her vote against, explains to Da Vinci that a better  option is to declare the racecourse a heritage site, in which case it would  revert back to the city for operation. Da Vinci learns through other  sources that Manning's sale of the track to Woo was a grand scheme between  the two to divert track business to another site owned by Woo in the  suburbs. With the pedophile case, Leary receives a first hand account from  a young male prostitute, Andrew, who was taken to the Century Club two  weeks previous. Jacobs wants to proceed with charges against Dubreau,  however Leary wants to wait to uncover more evidence as the ring seems to  be larger than just Dubreau. The latest possible group involved in the ring  is the BC judicial society. With the Stanley Park gay bashing, Katie tries  to plea bargain - information of who did the killing for a guarantee of any  prosecution against her. And Friedland suspects that Zack may be the mole  at the squat.    The Mayor proposes a drop-in center for the hookers in the fenced and gated  red-light district for their health and safety - they would be required to  go there following any business transaction in the district. He now needs  to sell the concept to everyone, the biggest hurdle being Jacobs. However  Da Vinci, Mah and Berger don't see it as an issue as they can get rid of  the chief under the ploy of an early performance review tied to budget  overruns in the department. Da Vinci learns it may be financially costly as  they may need to buy-out the chief's contract. Jacobs and Klotchko meet  with union chief, Earl Sweeney, to discuss police department PR problems.  Although the aboriginal community is uncertain Leary can accomplish  anything, they cooperate with him on his investigation of the repeated  rapes of young aboriginal boys, including the deaths of Garth and Dennis.  Messner admits that he knows more than he previously told Leary. Leary also  receives information that the perpetrator could have been a radio talk show  host and that the police may have been involved. Ferris and her gang of  renegade constables decide to take down what they suspect is a biker  grow-op regardless of if there are any other investigations on the house.  There, they find that the fire department, in a new initiative, has placed  a notice on the door stating that they are investigating the house, a  suspected grow-op, as a fire hazard. This measure clears out the house,  which irks Ferris and her gang who want the glory. Based on a tip, Carter  brings in a youth, Colin Rainier, as a suspect in the Lost Lagoon beating  death. Rainier implicates some of his colleagues, among which are a bunch  of girls, led by someone named Katie. Kosmo and Finn investigate a series  of car shooting deaths, some of which look to be mistaken identities. Tom  Venice gives Da Vinci short notice that he is selling the racetrack. Da  Vinci negotiates with Manning possibly to buy the track. Zack convinces  Friedland to take the squat to Crab Park instead of the touristy Queen  Elizabeth Park. Zack and Da Vinci also know that Jacobs has a mole in the  squat, but Zack doesn't yet know who it is. Just as they are about to move,  the police raid the squat and haul off Friedland while Da Vinci, Zack's  supposed protector, is doing a PR stint with Billie Simms.    The Red Light District opens relatively smoothly, despite both the johns  and the girls being wary about the openness. Businesses in the area are  starting to rally against it, the business coalition led by Mina Basra.  Klotchko and Sweeney get tipped that the city is doing a search for a new  police chief. The city starts their interviews and get valuable first hand  information on the value and effectiveness of cross training. There seems  to be unofficial cooperation happening already with the fire department  posting inspection notices on suspected grow-ops, which has the effect of  the house being vacated. However Ferris and her gang have different ideas,  Ferris who wants to make a name for herself in the police ranks. Klotchko  and Jacobs also do whatever they can to thwart the fire departments  measures as well as the success of the Red Light District. Despite the  police raid, the squat successfully moves from the Watson's Building to  Crab Park. However Da Vinci is dismayed to learn that Zack has taken a  leadership role in the squat, which would not look good if that were ever  made public. Kosmo and Finn continue their investigation of the drive-by  shootings, one of the deaths who looks to be the victim of mistaken  identity. The real target of the shootings seems to be an ex-police  officer, Vijay Kumar, who was fired from the force due to suspicions of  corruption. In his investigation of the aboriginal boys' case, Leary  discovers the name of the suspected ex-deejay involved, his name being  Anthony Mottola. Mottola's daughter provides Leary with some incriminating  evidence against her father. The evidence also points to there being an  organized pedophile ring. Both Manning and Woo independently show interest  in buying the race track, only if the slot machines are approved.    Both sides continue gathering their support on the cross training issue.  The side against, led by Jacobs and Klotchko, are spreading the word  amongst their and the fire department's union chiefs. They're all saying  that there are some senior people amongst their ranks who are in favor of  crossing training, and it's those people who have to go. These people  include Komori and perhaps Parmir. And although Jacobs has issued a  directive to his constables not to support the fire department when they  post inspection notices on suspected grow-ops, some constables are  unofficially defying the directive. On the side for, Da Vinci needs to make  his moves a little less public until he plots his entire strategy around  the issue. Berger and Forsythe, feeling the heat, convince Da Vinci to put  the issue on the back burner for the time being. Ferris and her gang are  relishing in the positive publicity in their take-down of a grow-op. The  next one, however, does not goes as well, as both the grow-op sitter and  Constable Barb Tremaine are killed in the process. Ferris is devastated as  it not only puts a crimp on her long term plan, but she was attracted to  Tremaine. Ferris' defense is that a warrant was on its way and that the  fire department unknowing to her and her colleagues placed an inspection  notice on the door which warned the home owners. Tremaine's death places  the issue of cross training back on the table. To deflect attention away  from Tremaine's death, Jacobs orders his constables to stir up action in  the Red Light District. Things turn again when there is a beating in the  Red Light District after Da Vinci orders Jacobs to stop harassing people in  the district, which Jacobs interprets, for his own purposes, as not having  any police presence at all in the district. Da Vinci orders Zack from the  squat at Crab Park, saying that his work is complete. But Zack now has an  emotional investment in what's happening at the squat. Da Vinci meets with  Friedland about an extended stay at Crab Park, this news which gets back to  Jacobs by his undercover operative. Friedland is aware that the police have  someone amongst his midst and asks Da Vinci to investigate. Leary gets some  positive results from the photographs provided by Mottola's daughter,  including the identification of some of the boys involved, and the hotel  where the boys were taken. This evidence leads to the suspected involvement  of a prominent businessman named James Dubreau. Kosmo and Finn learn more  about Kumar's investigations into South Asian gangs in an effort to clear  his name. Kosmo and Finn are looking for a undercover officer to infiltrate  the gang activity.    The issue of the fire inspection notice at the grow-op site comes into  question. Da Vinci thinks it a little too convenient that one was found  after a series of seasoned investigators didn't find it in their initial  walk-through. Winters admits in confidence to Klotchko that she is unsure  that a notice was at the scene. And even Jacobs admits he is skeptical.  Klotchko tries to manage the situation internally, seeming to support  Ferris in whatever she needs, while not allowing her back to work. He will  not even allow her to attend Tremaine's funeral. The fire and police  committee does however come back with a recommendation for a coordinated  approach to grow-ops, which delights Da Vinci. A B&E occurs at the  Coroner's office, and Leary's computer which was stolen. This may have  something to do with Dubreau, as Dubreau, Norton and Curtis confer about  managing the situation, which includes keeping tabs on Manny Zappata.  Despite the theft, the investigation continues: Leary has identified the  hotel where the boys were taken and Kosmo and Finn try to determine Curtis'  actual role in the pedophile ring. However, Zappata and Messner get nervous  about actually testifying, which may kibosh Leary being able to lay  charges. The hookers are now wary of the safety of the Red Light District  and move back to their old haunts. Jacobs uses the missing women's case as  a smoke-screen for police under-funding, not tying it in with the purpose  of the Red Light District. With City Hall business, Da Vinci shores up  support for slots at the racetrack and negotiates between all the players  regarding development on the waterfront in and around Crab Park. Katie is  brought in on assault charges, displaying that she is capable of violent  crime. Friedland may not be as he seems, and Zack does some digging into  his possible real identity.    Da Vinci greases the wheels on all sides: he lays down the law with both  the police and fire union reps using the tactic of the extra manpower on  the books, and discusses with Leary the progress in his investigation on  the grow-op shooting. On the down side, Jacobs has a meeting with the  Solicitor General about the relationship with the Police Board and Da  Vinci, the SG laying down the law with Da Vinci on this matter. However  some unexpected good news for Da Vinci comes via Lou in the coroner's  investigation: he has found evidence that the grow-op site was violated  after it was locked down, implying that the fire and rescue notice may have  been planted on the site after the lock down. This news, eventually the  major finding in the coroner's investigation report, provides leverage for  the Mayor in all these dealings, especially with the police department in  general and Jacobs in particular. Internal to the police, Klotchko  continues to play Ferris, who is feeling and showing the pressure of the  investigation. When all is said and done, Ferris solely takes the fall for  the notice planting. Although not coming out smelling totally like a rose,  both Klotchko and Jacobs are spared. Still feeling the heat, Jacobs kowtows  to the Mayor, saying that they should now work together, Jacobs even  stating that he will support the Mayor's controversial policies. Da Vinci  basically tells him to take a hike. Things on this front don't end smoothly  however as the fire department and many police officers threaten a major  work disruption based on Ferris being the scapegoat for larger systemic  issues within the police department. On another front, Da Vinci intervenes  with Pacific Comm for Manning. The Pacific Comm lawyer does not back down  as she says she has evidence of influence peddling on Manning's part for  the better part of 10 years. Manning does not take too kindly to the news  of this meeting outcome. Elsewhere, Det. Carter has laid "gay bashing"  murder charges against Clay and Reed based on Katie's evidence, although he  knows that she had a major role in the crime; just the fact that it is  being charged as a hate crime satisfies Councillor Horne. And the Mike  Franklin side of Joe Friedland emerges as he gets deep back into gambling  and is down $20,000 in a current poker game, money he doesn't have. With  the pedophile case, the perpetrators continue their back-room dealings with  the witnesses, albeit in a slightly heavier handed matter: Curtis murders  Mason. However Norton negotiates with Kosmo and Finn for Dubreau's return.  When Dubreau returns, the detectives state that the Crown has refused to  negotiate and they book him on murder charges.    Da Vinci is dealing with the fall-out from the homicide in the red light  district, the homicide taking place during the Prime Minister's tour.  Despite the Prime Minister still giving Da Vinci his support in private, it  seems that opposition to the red zone is mounting, connecting the death to  the zone itself. The attention is international, and some of Da Vinci's  councilors don't want to see the City become an international laughing  stock. Mina Basra and the wife of the deceased decide to sue the city over  the incident, stating that it would not have happened if the red zone did  not exist. Under this pressure, Da Vinci sticks to his guns and keeps the  zone open. The police complaints commission starts their investigation of  the grow-op shooting. Marx and Zurokowski, the two interviewers, are facing  what looks to be institutionalized non-compliance by the police department,  although Savoy is the one police officer who does speak to them. However,  Savoy doesn't mention that he was told by Klotchko not to cooperate. The  commission extends its investigation to fire & rescue, who openly decide  not to cooperate despite it being them who initiated the complaint. Da  Vinci decides that it might be good idea to co-opt lawyer Phil Rosen, who  has dealt with complaints against the police, to make sure the interests of  the mayor's office are protected in the investigation. Rosen is more than  happy to help Da Vinci bury Jacobs. Clay Douglas and Reed Baker, the two  that Katie has identified as the instigators of the gay bashing death at  Stanley Park, are brought in for questioning. They, in turn, implicate  Katie as being the sole instigator. Woo threatens to sue the City over the  heritage designation of the race track. Leary discovers more conclusive  evidence against Dubreau in the pedophile ring, but still hesitates to  bring him in officially as it will prompt others in the ring to go  underground. McNab and Friedland partially clear the air with each about  their true identities.    The investigation of the grow-op deaths gets under way. Jacobs, in an  effort to distance the police department from the killings, calls in the  Organized Crime Unit, stating that it is their jurisdiction since it is  purported that a major drug organization is involved. This is only one area  of disagreement as Chick, the lead investigator, states that the grow-op  involved was a "Mom and Pop" operation. The other major disagreement is  between Ferris, Winters, by association the police department and the fire  department. Ferris and Winters emphatically state that they saw a  inspection notice at the grow-op issued by the fire department, that notice  which was not recovered at the scene. Ferris and Winters imply that the  fire department, protecting their own, took the notice away from the crime  scene. Komori flatly denies that a notice was issued at that house. After  Da Vinci gets police and fire together to discuss the situation amicably,  an inspection notice is found at the crime scene, five days after the fact.  Leary's investigation into Dubreau gets deeper. Leary investigates a former  charge against Dubreau, that issued by a former street hustler, Manny  Zapata. Zapata names a former narc as an accomplice of Dubreau's, that narc  being Brian Curtis. The Red Light District gets a little quieter following  the beating of a john. Both the johns and girls in the district are  nervous. An official citizen's coalition of purported business owners of  the district has lodged a complaint against the district. Mah however can't  find any of the "names" on the coalition as being business owners of the  area. It seems as if Billie Simms may be involved. Da Vinci tries to  maintain control of the squat at Crab Park, especially as it is on federal  land and the Port Authority, to whom the land belongs, wants the land back  for major development. Katie is brought in for questioning regarding the  gay bashing death in Stanley Park.    This episode and the series picks up where "Da Vinci's Inquest" left off.  We see Dominic Da Vinci has moved from the halls of the city coroner's  office to those of City Hall as the newly elected Mayor of Vancouver. One  of his first official PR opportunities as Mayor takes place at a night out  at the local Hastings Park horse racetrack. With his two aides, Sam Berger  and Rita Mah, running detail duty, Da Vinci is introduced to Lloyd Manning  and Roger Woo, who independent of each other have the potential to be the  savior of the financially troubled racetrack as its new owner. Further PR  for Da Vinci takes place the next morning when Da Vinci is invited to a  pancake breakfast at an elementary school located in a poorer section of  town. The school's principal voices to Da Vinci her opposition to a  proposed park nearby. More green space appears to be a motherhood issue,  however her opposition stems from her fears that it will be a breeding  ground for drug dealers and pimps preying on her students. The pimps are  especially troublesome in her mind as the school is located close to the  City's known "kiddie stroll". Two homicides investigations are also  underway the morning after. The first is of a formerly diagnosed mentally  ill man living in a half-way house in a effort to get readjusted to  community life. The investigation is led by reinstated Homicide Det. Angela  Kosmo and her new partner Det. Joe Finn, formerly of Internal  Investigations. In that previous life, Finn did investigate some unfounded  allegations of police impropriety by Angela which led to her demotion from  Homicide. On the surface, their new partnership does not seem to be  suffering from their past animosity. Also on site are Kosmo's former  partner Mick Leary, who is there in his new role as City Coroner - Da  Vinci's old job - the detective's superior Police Chief Bill Jacobs and his  opportunistic second in command Sgt. Charlie Klotchko, the latter two who  voice their opposition to such half-way houses located in residential  neighborhoods. Kosmo and Finn eventually solve this homicide, perpetrated  by a half-way house neighbor with night vision goggles and a high-powered  rifle, but not before Finn is attacked and bitten by the neighbor's dog,  who Finn shoots dead. The second homicide looks to be a gay-bashing which  took place along what is known as the gay stroll in Stanley Park.  Councillor Jason Horne has taken a special interest in this case as a  representative of the gay community. Det. Chick Savoy, also new to homicide  from his previous role as police forensics expert, and Lou from the  coroner's office undercover two bodies of young boys found buried deep in a  city park. Long deceased and found near the site where another body had  previously been found, Leary suspects that they are the bodies of two  missing aboriginal youth and that the three bodies are associated with a  possible pedophile ring from about 10 or 15 years earlier. The political  differences between Da Vinci and Jacobs resurface - not that they ever  probably went away - in the police's handling of a squat in a commercial  building which is planned for redevelopment, the squat led by homeless  activist Joe Friedland. Jacobs uses the force of the police department to  harass the squatters, while Da Vinci prefers to negotiate with Friedland,  with whom he promises to find suitable permanent accommodation for those  homeless in the squat. This episode with the squat is just start of the  power struggle between the Mayor and the Police Chief in their roles as  City officials. They also clash on manpower issues, the unresolved conflict  resulting in each side plotting against the other while Jacobs and Klotchko  continually feign cooperation with the Mayor. Back with the homeless issue,  Da Vinci calls in retired traffic detective Zack McNab to act as his  undercover eyes and ears at the squat. Two developments take place back at  City Hall. The first has Manning, who looks to be the main contender for  purchasing the racetrack, accusing that there was a leak in information  which caused him to lose the City's lucrative advertising contract during  the previous administration. Da Vinci needs to placate Manning in the  continuing negotiation for the racetrack purchase, but also believes there  may be some merit to Manning's accusations. With the racetrack, part of the  selling feature may be Da Vinci's ability to influence Council to install  slot machines at the track to increase revenues both for its owner and for  the City. The second is Da Vinci's first meeting with City Administrator  Julia Forsythe, who discuss the possibility of cross training between the  police and fire departments in an effort to increase efficiency, increase  overall manpower and save money. Forsythe supports the idea in theory and  promises to look further into this issue. This ends a busy first week for  the new Mayor.    Written by 'David S. Goyer' (qv), the series follows the "untold" story of  Leonardo Da Vinci: the genius during his early years in Renaissance  Florence.
