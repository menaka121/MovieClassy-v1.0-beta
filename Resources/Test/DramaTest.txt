 MV: Anatomy of Anatomy (2014)  PL: When legendary Hollywood director Otto Preminger chose Michigan's rustic PL: Upper Peninsula as the filming location for Anatomy of a Murder (1959), he PL: not only changed the way movies would get made for decades to come, he PL: forever altered a Midwestern community. Anatomy of 'Anatomy' tells the PL: story of how Marquette became the backdrop for an Oscar-nominated motion PL: picture and how the lives of the locals it touched were never the same PL: again.  BY: Anonymous  PL: In 1959, larger-than-life director Otto Preminger made his way to a small PL: town in Michigan's Upper Peninsula to direct a movie that was based on the PL: writings of small-town fisherman and attorney John D. Voelker, who went by PL: the pen name John Traver. The movie carried the same title as Voelker's PL: best selling novel, Anatomy of a Murder. The film went on to receive seven PL: Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture. It has been described as PL: one of the finest pure trial films ever made. Just as courtroom dramas PL: would never be the same, neither would the hamlet of Ishpeming. The PL: documentary Anatomy of 'Anatomy' brings to life the memoir of Joan Hansen, PL: who was an inn hostess at the time Anatomy of a Murder was being made. PL: Hansen was a friend and neighbor of the Voelker family and befriended many PL: of the actors who took up residence at the Mather Inn during the filming. PL: In fact, she formed a special bond with Duke Ellington, who in turn wrote a PL: song for the movie based on Hansen's walk. He named the song Flirtbird. PL: Hansen's writings not only detailed her personal knowledge of the author PL: and her relationship with the actors, they relayed the impact this film had PL: on the small Michigan town. The movie's influence is still noticeable PL: today. In the documentary, Hansen's words are woven with a combination of PL: old photographs and recollections from those who took part in the magical PL: film making of this courtroom classic. Topics addressed in the film include PL: Otto Preminger's infamous temper, Ben Gazzara's flirty nature, Jimmy PL: Stewart's charm and ease, Duke Ellington's generosity, George C. Scott's PL: fondness for a drink, Eve Arden's tender nature and how leading actress and PL: new mother Lee Remick juggled her professional and maternal roles. The PL: groundbreaking film itself is also explored. The story, based on a real PL: courtroom case, provides a clear window into what happens in the courtroom PL: and continues to serve as the courtroom drama that all others are measured PL: by. The dialog of the famous drama also altered the industry. Never before PL: had film goers been exposed to sex and rape in such graphics terms. What's PL: more, Anatomy of a Murder made its mark on Hollywood by going outside of PL: Hollywood. Shooting a film entirely on location was certainly not the norm PL: in those days. Indeed, Anatomy of a Murder has made a lasting impact on the PL: movie industry and the locals of Ishpeming. Now, the documentary Anatomy of PL: 'Anatomy' enables everyone to go inside the making of the movie from the PL: perspective of those who lived it.  BY: Claire Wiley

This new documentary PL: explores this revolutionary trend in restoring basic human needs in a world PL: where human touch seems to happen less and less.  BY: Anonymous  PL: Documentary chronicling a unique and revolutionary movement taking place PL: around the world. For years, people have been getting together at cuddle PL: parties, where non-sexual physical touch can be practiced and explored PL: within a safe and innocent setting. In a couple of cities, and most PL: recently, in Madison, Wisconsin, new businesses are opening and facing huge PL: controversy to offer one-on-one snuggling sessions for paying customers... PL: again, in a completely safe and non-sexual environment. In each of these PL: instances, the misconceptions and misunderstandings of others have caused PL: controversy, and have sometimes made it difficult for people to see the PL: benefits that these services and events can provide, and it ends up dealing PL: so much with how we view touch in America and how the lines have blurred PL: between compassion and sex. Can these movements succeed and allow others to PL: see how finding ways to get back to our most basic human needs could PL: actually be a positive step forward for our society? Or will these PL: movements face too much misunderstanding and founder? This new documentary PL: explores it all. Jason first began by covering the return of the Cuddle PL: Party movement in Birmingham, Alabama, interviewing facilitators Tracy and PL: Bryan Gilliom, and a first time Cuddle Party attendee, Kate Donnelly, whose PL: insights and anxiety about attending a cuddle party lend an interesting PL: look into this event that has been around for a number of years. Jason then PL: traveled to Madison, Wisconsin, right in the midst of the huge controversy PL: that erupted around the opening of The Snuggle House, a new business PL: offering one-on-one snuggling services. Self made millionaire Matthew David PL: Hurtado explained his desire to open this new business and the struggles he PL: faced in the city from those who thought it was a front for prostitution. PL: Jason then traveled to Boulder, Colorado, where a man named Chris DeCicco PL: was already operating a one-on-one snuggling business called "Be The Love PL: You Are". Jason was granted unprecedented access, filming many one-on-one PL: snuggling sessions and interviews with snugglers and clients. It was then PL: on to San Francisco to interview a man who founded "Cuddle Therapy" and a PL: woman who helped co-found the Cuddle Party movement almost a decade ago. PL: The travels concluded in New York to interview the innovating woman who PL: first started the one-on-one snuggling business when she opened The PL: Snuggery in Rochester, and a woman about to open up her own cuddling PL: business after having coached women who had not been nurtured by their PL: mothers. Provocative and eye opening, the film presents an insight into a PL: phenomenon desperately searching for mainstream acceptance, as well as PL: working to bring us back to the most basic human needs we all inherently PL: knew from childbirth.

 MV: Nun Wa Zaytun (2014)  PL: While listening to the stories of the people Murad meets with his Mobile PL: Cinema, trekking from one venue to another, Nun wa Zaytun transports us to PL: another Palestine. We encounter a simple rural life, far from the cultural PL: and social stereotypes of modern, urban Ramallah or Tel Aviv, only PL: kilometers away. Scattered communities come together for a moment to watch PL: films shot in Palestine over 20 years and in which some of them even acted. PL: This moment of communal harmony and artistic pleasure contrasts rudely with PL: the bitter realities they face in coping with encroaching settlements, the PL: attrition of ancestral land and the daily brutalities of occupation and PL: poverty. From Yanun, where only 5% of the village olive groves are still PL: freely accessible, to Aqabat Jabr camp where refugees wait to return all PL: the while trying to cope, to Bethlehem which gathers in solidarity with PL: Gaza under attack, Murad's films allow people a moment of reverie and hope. PL: In Bayt Marsam, we hear tales of Pharoahs, pyramids, lost jewels and PL: fanatic Israeli and American archaeologists. In the "Hani Amer State", PL: enclosed by Israeli settlements and checkpoints and the wall on all sides, PL: we share a love story of Shakesperean dimensions. From all these unknown PL: and proud Palestinians we learn that their attachment to their land, their PL: homes and families and to their disappearing way of life remains as strong PL: as the Zaytun roots and branches, against all odds and despite all they PL: have endured for generations.  BY: Emtiaz Diab  PL: Nun, the 'n' of zaytun, is the sound of olives falling to the ground, the PL: sound of ancient zaytun branches bending in the wind and of leaves PL: rustling, of presses squeezing their oil, the sound of the land that PL: envelops the zaytun roots.

 MV: Oilfields Mines Hurricanes (2014)  PL: OILFIELDS MINES HURRICANES is a road-movie, in which the classical concept PL: of that genre - the quest for and the fixation of the own identity - is PL: lead ad absurdum: Salpa, the traveler, experiences a corrosion of his PL: all-along-multiple identity. This is already founded within the production: PL: 18 authors have taken turns writing the screenplay. The amount and sequence PL: of the scenes correlate with John Cage's organ piece As Slow As Possible. PL: The performance venue of that piece, Halberstadt, is the apparent PL: destination of Salpa's journey. But, arrived, no redemption is waiting; PL: Salpa again finds himself thrown back onto himself and alone. For Salpa's PL: journey each author depicts another fragmented world for Salpa to dive in, PL: and each of them poses him, always confused & disorientated but determined, PL: with the question of his own identity. The further he gets away from the PL: beginning, the more the destination seems to fade away. Estranged Salpa PL: meanders through different possibility-worlds, which don't provide the PL: right answer for his questions, who he is, what is left of him and what he PL: has lost within himself along with the loss of the other. Is Salpa like a PL: migratory bird in a flock, or someone reflecting the relations to his PL: father? Which gender does Salpa claim? What is ascribed to him? What does PL: define him without the other? We experience Salpa's tale through PL: non-stringent and non-causal narrations which unfold web-like over the PL: whole movie: Salpa is constantly looking for contact with his surrounding, PL: fails and enmeshes himself deeper and deeper in his identity which is more PL: and more under deconstruction. Salpa's �companion� is a salp, a primitive PL: fish, which Salpa is carrying as a prosthesis on his lower face. The origin PL: of his prosthesis he finds in Iceland, where to he followed a mysterious PL: tale of a flock of birds which froze to death in the air and dropped on the PL: glacier. During the movie Salpa is testing the possibility of a symbiosis PL: with the prosthesis whilst entrapping himself in more than one discourse PL: around his seemingly lost place in the world. The salp takes on different PL: roles and functions: It serves as an idealistic dialogue-partner, as a PL: connection-tool to the outside, as an alter-ego and as a clumsy chauffeur PL: on the trip which the two have embarked on together. The destination is PL: unknown, but something pushes them forward, maybe the dark pitches, which PL: are omnipresent below the surface, or Salpa's voice from the car-radio? And PL: who gets homesick while watching a maritime documentary, Salpa or the fish? PL: Salpa, the seeker, is a metaphor for the loss of a world, for a destination PL: gone missing without the end of the quest for it.

Solitary musical explorations have enabled a real sense of PL: self-discovery and emotional self-knowledge. This deep, new confidence, PL: combined with the widening validation of his community, lets us see a man PL: alive with gratitude and wonder as never before. Part biopic, part music PL: video, part tribute to gothic beauty, this affecting film pays witness to PL: the emotional armour of a scarred man, and to the thundering growl that PL: emerges when he peels it off.

 MV: The God Question (2014)  PL: A startling breakthrough in artificial intelligence at MIT produces the PL: first super-intelligent computer capable of thinking independently, as PL: humans do. With an "IQ" that is incalculable, it is fluent in all languages PL: and able to read a book in a fraction of a second. Stephen Kendrick, who PL: runs a government supercomputer at University of Massachusetts in Amherst, PL: previously taught at MIT and was one of the key code writers for the PL: project. Hearing this, a Yale philosopher, Jane Hurst, suggests the PL: following to him: Feed the computer every book, news article, research PL: paper, and Internet posting - essentially all human knowledge - then ask it PL: the ultimate question. Is there evidence for God, for a spiritual framework PL: to life? "This computer is smarter than any of us, than all of us put PL: together. Maybe it can make a novel interpretation of the human experience, PL: something no one has ever thought of, to say whether the idea of a god PL: makes sense," she says. Kendrick tells her the question is one of the first PL: the MIT team plans to ask. "This particular question is exactly the kind of PL: thing it could tackle. It doesn't think like us. It can see everything at PL: once. Everything." News then emerges that the MIT computer was allowed onto PL: the Internet and promptly shut down hundreds of websites it found PL: offensive. As a result, federal officials quickly shut down the computer, PL: padlock the MIT lab and ban any use of the program until it can be studied. PL: However, Kendrick has a copy of the software - the only copy that exists PL: outside of MIT. Since he has a supercomputer capable of running it, he PL: decides to defy the federal ban and ask the question himself, aided by a PL: colleague, Alan Moss. Moss, though, is more focused on the fame and wealth PL: the effort is likely to bring him, should the computer get any answer at PL: all - yes, no or something in between. The two decide to attempt it on a PL: weekend, when Kendrick's supercomputer is idle. The story is about their PL: efforts to wring the answer from their colossally intelligent but PL: temperamental computer, as the FBI and a congressional panel work to thwart PL: any use of the MIT software.

Elsewhere, the character of a Hedge PL: Fund Manager in London brings an external viewpoint on events. Other PL: characters come and go, but these are the key decision makers.

Smoking PL: meat, sharing stories of life, survival and togetherness is a primal thread PL: of the human experience the world over, and no country on Earth has PL: barbecue running through its veins quite like America. "The United States PL: of BBQ" is really several interlocking stories in one. At its heart, is a PL: tender and simple generational tale of family and tradition embodied in PL: renown pit master Garry Roark and the Ubon's BBQ family of Yazoo City, PL: Mississippi. At first taste, Garry's world may seem like a simple recipe PL: for living, laid back and in the BBQ vernacular, "cooked low and slow", but PL: each successive bite reveals so much more. Soon, the world of BBQ explodes PL: with a rich complexity of flavors both literal and cultural.

 MV: The Universe (2014/III)  PL: This short provides a philosophical investigation on the experiences of PL: life, what it means to be - to interact with reality, and why reflection PL: and experiencing are mutually exclusive. Filmed in many different iconic PL: locations across the United States, namely Moab, Yosemite, Big Sur, PL: Colorado, and the Sierra Nevadas, the film explores different natural PL: experiences and couples them with reflections on human existence, the PL: validity of the experiences within reality, and the foundational role that PL: perception plays in understanding the world as well as engaging with the PL: world. The film also portrays and investigates inner conflicts with major PL: ideas concerning human existence such as mortality, care, anxiety, PL: temporality, and historicity. The film's investigation originates from the PL: Lockean self: the idea that a "being" is a self-aware and self-reflective PL: consciousness that is fixed in a body. Merleau-Ponty emphasized the body as PL: the primary site of knowing the world, a corrective to the long PL: philosophical tradition of placing consciousness as the source of PL: knowledge, and maintained that the body and that which it perceived could PL: not be disentangled from each other. Setting aside John Locke's PL: propositions on Ausgustinian original sin and the Cartesian position of PL: man's innate knowledge of logical propositions, the film further employs PL: Locke's posited tabula rasa, which is an "empty" mind that is shaped by PL: experience. Locke continues to surmise that sensation and reflection are PL: the two sources of all our ideas as humans. Edmund Husserl developed some PL: key conceptual elaborations which led him to assert that in order to study PL: the structure of consciousness, one would have to distinguish between the PL: act of consciousness and the phenomena at which it is directed. Thus PL: creating Phenomenology, or the study of the structure of an experience, PL: Husserl further developed an ancient Grecian idea, epoche, or "suspension" PL: that refers to a theoretical moment where all judgments about the existence PL: of the external world, and the actions therein, is suspended. The film PL: builds off of two ideas to explore major modern phenomenologist claims: the PL: true nature of being is withdrawal, and that experience and reflection are PL: the source of human existence.
